Carolyn Lukensmeyer is the President and Founder of AmericaSpeaks. Its partners have included regional planning groups, local, state, and national government bodies, national and international organizations. Issues have ranged from Social Security reform, the redevelopment of ground zero in New York and rebuilding New Orleans. <a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a></p><h2>Mission and Purpose</h2><p>AmericaSpeaks is a non-profit and non-partisan organization that focuses on organizing regional and national citizen meetings. The mission of AmericaSpeaks is to \u201creinvigorate American democracy by engaging citizens in the public decision-making that most impacts their lives.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a> The primary focus of the meetings is issues that revolve around issues with a significant budget impact. Another focus of AmericaSpeaks is to integrate solid democratic deliberation with technology and new media. Their aim for national citizen meetings goes beyond the small groups within a given community. AmericaSpeaks wants to connect citizens not only from different cultural backgrounds, but also geographic backgrounds. This is achieved with the utilization of satellites, keypad polling, and web conferences in order to connect citizens across the nation.</p><p>In addition to civic and technological engagement, AmericaSpeaks seeks to expand academia\u2019s knowledge on the deliberative process. A subgroup of AmericaSpeaks known as the Democracy Lab for Research and Innovation has three goals in this field. They aim to \u201cexpand our knowledge about the practice of public deliberation, develop new and better ways to engage citizens to improve democratic processes and institutions, and foster and increase collaboration within the field of deliberative democracy.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a> AmericaSpeaks envisions that their citizen forums will inspire the \"public's business [to] be conducted differently - that by developing a rich national infrastructure for democratic deliberation through our projects, innovation and collaboration, [government] can access the collective wisdom of the American people.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a> <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>AmericaSpeaks was founded in 1995. Since then, it has engaged over 145,000 people in over 50 large-scale forums in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. AmericaSpeaks aims to bring citizens together to deliberate about critical policy issues. The conclusions from these meetings are then brought to the attention of decision-makers in the hopes that citizen input will influence policy.</p><p>In 1994, after more than ten years of service in the public sector, AmericaSpeaks president Carolyn Lukensmeyer had grown concerned that citizens were increasingly being shut out of public decision-making processes. Carolyn traveled the United States and held vision meetings to conceptualize a model for large-scale citizen engagement forums, and a vision for how these forums could be used in national dialogues on key public policy issues. AmericaSpeaks\u2019 mission is to create innovative mechanisms through which citizens can enhance their voice in local, regional, and national governance, and to renew democracy through the development of a national infrastructure for democratic deliberation and citizen engagement. <a id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2><p><a id=\"21st_Century_Town_Meeting\" name=\"21st_Century_Town_Meeting\"></a>21st Century Town Meeting</p><p>AmericaSpeaks\u2019 <a href=\"/methods/21st-century-town-meeting\" title=\"21st Century Town Meeting\">21st Century Town Meeting</a> is intended to create engaging, meaningful opportunities for citizens to participate in public decision making. This process attempts to update the traditional <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=New_England&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"New England (page does not exist)\">New England</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Town_meeting\" title=\"Town meeting\">town meeting</a> to address the needs of today\u2019s citizens, decision makers and democracy. Unlike most of New England's town meetings, however, it is not a formal legislative body, and therefore none of the decisions are binding.</p><p>The 21st Century Town Meeting marks a departure from traditional public participation methods, such as public hearings. The 21st Century Town Meeting focuses on discussion and deliberation among citizens rather than speeches, question-and-answer sessions or panel presentations. The purpose of the Town Hall Meeting is to gather diverse groups of citizens who will participate in round-table discussions (10-12 people per table) and deliberate in depth about key policy issues. Each table discussion is supported by a trained facilitator to keep participants on task. Participants receive discussion guides that present further information about the issues under consideration.</p><p>Technology collects the individual table discussions and the results are compiled into a set of collective recommendations. Each table submits ideas using wireless groupware computers and each participant can vote on specific proposals with keypad polling. These two pieces of technology allow for real-time reporting and voting. Results from discussions are presented to participants within minutes and polling results within seconds. The entire group votes on the final recommendations to submit to decision makers. Before the meeting ends, results from the meeting are put into a report, which is distributed to participants, decision makers and the <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=News_media&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"News media (page does not exist)\">news media</a> as they leave. <a id=\"21st_Century_Summit\" name=\"21st_Century_Summit\"></a></p><h3>21st Century Summit</h3><p>The 21st Century Summit was created to help organization leaders tap into the collective wisdom of their constituents and stakeholders through large-scale meetings. During discussions, participants identify shared priorities and develop recommendations on essential policies and plans. At the meeting, AmericaSpeaks attempts to help attendees explore key issues, weigh critical trade offs, and deepen their connection and commitment to next steps. AmericaSpeaks has more than a decade of experience with engaging large numbers of members, employees or stakeholders \u2013 50 to 5,000 at a single meeting \u2013 in a strategic, outcomes-oriented discussion. The method integrates recent technology with facilitated dialogue, and provides the tools to enable groups to examine important options and identify mutual priorities. <a id=\"Americans_Discuss_Social_Security\" name=\"Americans_Discuss_Social_Security\"></a></p><h3>Americans Discuss Social Security</h3><p>\"Americans Discuss Social Security\" was a 1998 non-partisan effort funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, that directly engaged a diverse sample of Americans in a dialogue about Social Security (United States)|Social Security reform and recommended that the United States Congress support legislation that reflected citizen preferences. Over fifteen months, the project engaged nearly 45,000 Americans in every state in direct discussions on Social Security reform and reached more than twelve million through the project\u2019s media and public education efforts. <a id=\"Citizen_Summits_in_Washington.2C_DC\" name=\"Citizen_Summits_in_Washington.2C_DC\"></a></p><h3>Citizen Summits in Washington, DC</h3><p>Beginning in 1999 and lasting until 2005, Mayor Anthony Williams partnered with AmericaSpeaks in an attempt to restore Washingtonians' faith in the government and gather recommendations for budgeting allocation. Over 13,500 citizens participated in seven 21st Century Town Meetings.</p><p>Because of the Citizen Summits, millions of dollars were budgeted to areas over which citizens voiced concern, including: an additional $270 million for education; $10 million for senior services; 1,000 new drug treatment slots; an additional $25 million for a housing trust fund; $2 million for citizen involvement; and nearly $20 million for more police and juvenile-related initiatives. Also, the mayor's office created and implemented the Office of Neighborhood Action, which is responsible for ensuring that citizens have a voice in shaping the city\u2019s priorities. <a id=\"Redeveloping_Ground_Zero\" name=\"Redeveloping_Ground_Zero\"></a></p><h3>Redeveloping Ground Zero</h3><p>Listening to the City was held at the Javits Center in New York City in July 2002 to involve 4300 local citizens, who closely reflected the demographic diversity of the region, in the planning process for Ground Zero's future. Decision-makers from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority co-sponsored the meeting and incorporated it into their official public engagement process. After a day of intense deliberation, participants determined that the original plans for the redevelopment of the World Trade Center failed to meet the needs of the city. Within a week of Listening to the City, decision-makers announced that the plans would be redrawn in accordance with public priorities. A two-week online deliberation and dialogue reached another 800 New York City residents who reviewed the site options in small cyber groups. <a id=\"2005_World_Economic_Forum\" name=\"2005_World_Economic_Forum\"></a></p><h3>2005 World Economic Forum</h3><p>The 2005 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland featured a Global Town Hall Meeting by AmericaSpeaks\u2019 international arm, Global Voices, where 700 world leaders prioritized and addressed some of the toughest issues facing the global community. Poverty and Equitable Globalization were voted the two top priorities. <a id=\"_European_Citizens.27_Deliberate_of_Brain_Science\" name=\"_European_Citizens.27_Deliberate_of_Brain_Science\"></a></p><h3>Meeting of the Minds: European Citizens' Deliberate of Brain Science</h3><p>Over the course 2005, 126 citizens met up a handful of times within their own country and twice with citizens from other countries in order to discuss \u201cthe ethical, social, and legal implications of brain science policy and technology.\u201d Participating nations included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungry, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a> The focus of the discussion was broken up into 6 themes: regulation and control, normalcy vs. diversity, information and communication, equal access to treatment, pressure from economic interests, and freedom of choice.</p><p>After these meetings, the citizens turned in a summary of their findings in January of 2006 to the European Parliament. These recommendations and insights were later used by other organizations such as the European Group on Ethics in Science, the European Union, and New Technologies. This project was run by the pan-national department of AmericaSpeaks, known as Global Voices. <a id=\"Our_Budget.2C_Our_Economy\" name=\"Our_Budget.2C_Our_Economy\"></a></p><h3>Our Budget, Our Economy</h3><p>Thousands of citizens from 20 major cities are expected to participate in a national discussion set to take place on June 26, 2010. Unlike previous AmericaSpeak forums, this will be the first of their forums that will have different cities simultaneously and collectively participate with others. 32 individuals from Institutions such as the Heritage Foundation plus local outreach partners will comprise AmericaSpeak\u2019s Nation Advisory Committee that will oversee the proceedings. These people will act as moderators and advisors for the meetings.</p><p>The main issue of the forum is the recent budget crisis and discussing solutions to the nation\u2019s recession. After the meeting has taken place, the opinions and recommendations of the participants will be condensed into a report that will be presented to the National Commission on Responsibility and Reform and the Bi-Partisan Policy Center\u2019s Debt Reduction Task Force. <a id=\"Organizations\" name=\"Organizations\"></a></p><h2>Organizations</h2><p><a id=\"Voices_.26_Choices\" name=\"Voices_.26_Choices\"></a>Voices &amp; Choices</p><p>AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Fund for Our Economic Future to organize a series of town meetings and public forums across northeast Ohio to enable thousands of people to come together to create a strategic plan for revitalizing the region's economy. One of the largest public deliberations convened, Voices &amp; Choices combined a variety of approaches for mobilizing the region\u2019s citizenry, including one-on-one interviews, online forums and two large-scale 21st Century Town Meetings. Over 20,000 participants identified the region\u2019s strengths, identified and prioritized its most important challenges and brainstormed solutions. <a id=\"Citizens.27_Health_Care_Working_Group\" name=\"Citizens.27_Health_Care_Working_Group\"></a></p><h3>Citizens' Health Care Working Group</h3><p>AmericaSpeaks worked with the Citizens' Health Care Working Group to engage thousands of Americans in a national discussion on health care reform. 21st Century Town Meetings were held in Los Angeles and Cincinnati. Smaller forums were held in other cities throughout the nation. <a id=\"Unified_New_Orleans_Plan\" name=\"Unified_New_Orleans_Plan\"></a></p><h3>Unified New Orleans Plan</h3><p>AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to bring together nearly 4000 New Orleanians in two large-scale public meetings to develop and review elements of a city wide-plan for recovery. The December 2006 and January 2007 Community Congresses were multi-site meetings that connected participants over geographical distances using satellite video and webcast.</p><p>Community Congress II (December 2 2006) and Community Congress III (January 20, 2007) were both held simultaneously in New Orleans and other American cities with the large numbers of Katrina evacuees (New Orleans diaspora). AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to design, recruit participants and implement these meetings. When polled at the meetings, the participant groups closely approximated the pre-Katrina demographics of New Orleans: In pre-Katrina New Orleans, 67% were African-American and 37% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress II, 64% were African-American and 25% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress III, 55% were African-American and 24% had household income under $20,000. Renters, however, were significantly underrepresented - prior to Hurricane Katrina, 54% of the population were renters, while they made up only 29% of the participants.</p><p>The meetings connected New Orleanians at home with friends and neighbors who have not yet made it home through the use of Internet webcast technology or closed circuit television. Community Congress III presented the draft plan to citizens, incorporating many of the recommendations from Community Congress II, and 92% of participants expressed support for the Plan to go forward.</p><p>In late May 2007, $117 million in federal block grants was released for infrastructure repairs when the Louisiana Recovery Authority board accepted New Orleans' citywide recovery plan. The money is the first step toward financing a city recovery plan officials say will cost $1.1 billion. When releasing the money, The Louisiana Recovery Authority board recognized that the Unified New Orleans Plan was a citizen- driven recovery vision developed with \"unprecedented participation and representation from every part of the city.\" <a id=\"CaliforniaSpeaks\" name=\"CaliforniaSpeaks\"></a></p><h3>CaliforniaSpeaks</h3><p>Nearly 3,500 Californians gathered in eight cities on August 11, 2007 in an interactive forum on health care priorities called <a href=\"/cases/californiaspeaks\" title=\"CaliforniaSpeaks\">CaliforniaSpeaks</a>, and 82 percent advocated major changes. The project was created and led by AmericaSpeaks.</p><p>The most popular suggestions called for putting people before profit, prioritizing wellness and prevention, and making health care affordable and accessible to everyone. The statewide conversation was created to enable ordinary Californians to tell state lawmakers what they think about the current health care reform proposals. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, Senate President pro Tem Don Perata, Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines and other Republican and Democratic legislators attended the event. Each of the lawmakers emphasized his commitment to passing health care reform in 2007.</p><p>The real-time, nonpartisan health care discussion blended small-group dialogue with cutting-edge technology. Satellite television, webcast, simultaneous television broadcast, groupware and individual voting keypads were used. Forums were held in Sacramento, San Diego, Eureka, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Oakland-San Francisco and Riverside-San Bernardino. <a id=\"Democracy_Lab_for_Innovative_and_Research\" name=\"Democracy_Lab_for_Innovative_and_Research\"></a></p><h3>Democracy Lab for Innovative and Research</h3><p>AmericaSpeaks is dedicated to advancing citizen deliberation and aims to one day create an infrastructure in the United States that deeply incorporates citizens into the decision-making process. The Democracy Lab for Innovation and Research is AmericaSpeaks\u2019 think tank on deliberative democracy and citizen engagement. The Democracy Lab develops methods to advance and sustain citizen engagement in the public policy process. AmericaSpeaks formed the Democracy Lab in order to: Improve democratic processes and institutions by creating a new governance mechanism that will regularly convene diverse groups of Americans on key policy questions and incorporate citizen voices into policy making; Enhance and improve AmericaSpeaks\u2019 approach to citizen engagement, such as developing new models for sustaining citizen participation and turning initial participation in deliberation into long-term citizen engagement and action; Evaluate the impact of AmericaSpeaks\u2019 citizen engagement initiatives; Strengthen the deliberative democracy field by disseminating knowledge gained by AmericaSpeaks through its projects and research.

Later, in 1989, the foundation established the Study Circles Resource Center as its primary project.</p><p>In the early 1990s, the Study Circles Resource Center created and distributed tools such as discussion guides to help individuals in local communities engage in inclusive talk about public issues and controversies. Throughout the 1990s, the organization fostered a national network of discursive coalitions that addressed issues such as racism, inter-ethnic relations, and diversity. Since the 2000, the organization expanded its activities to include community organizing in order to diversify participation in dialogue and focus attention on action as well as deliberation. In 2008, the organization changed its name from the Study Circles Resource Center to Everyday Democracy to reflect its increased attention to collective action and public problem solving.

Could greater participation of the public in political processes lead to better, fairer, more sustainable decisions, and, if so, how could this best be achieved?</p><p>During 2008, the Partnership for Public Participation was formed to research experiences and results of public participation throughout the world, but particularly in three European countries of interest to the partners: Germany, Italy and United Kingdom.

and to provide decision makers with reliable input on the landscape or arguments, preferences, positions and options, as to enable better public policy or organisation/company strategy choices.</p><p>The firm assists local communities, regions, public agencies and private firms with the design of online participatory platforms according to their particular needs and requirements. It develops innovative software solutions for online debates and consultations, provides consulting services and help with the integration of its software on a variety of online platforms.</p><p>In addition to the design and development of participatory platforms, Sopinspace offers its services in management, moderation, mapping and synthesis of ongoing debates. The firm's debate teams usually constitute of a cartographer who maintains the debate map, a media monitor who follows the general or specialized news on the debate's subject and informs the participants on relevant developments, a fact finder who searches (on request) for facts needed to validate or invalidate arguments, a scientific mediator who summarizes and comments on scientific papers and reports to make them more accessible for laypeople, etc.</p><p>Sopinspace also operates a French speaking collaborative blog and information resource on on-line debates and their tools.</p><p><a id=\"Products\" name=\"Products\"></a></p><h2>Products </h2><p>Since its foundation the firm has developed several free software products <a href=\"#cite_note-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a>.</p><p>1. Co-ment\u00ae <a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a>: a Web 2.0 text annotation application that allows users to upload texts, post comments and collaboratively edit texts. Users may enclose comments and responses to every word in the text. The scope of application of co-ment is much wider than on-line debates, but it has interesting applications in this domain. co-ment can be seamlessly integrated in Drupal sites thanks to the Drupal co-ment module <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a>.</p><p>2. Glinkr\u00ae <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a>: this Web service enables to produce graphical interactive maps of Web contents. In the context of online debates, such maps represent the structure of arguments and viewpoints brought up in the discussion.

Tools for the collective evaluation of proposals or stakes to be debated, using graduated notation techniques.

Its purpose was to discuss the adoption of open access and open source standards in the universities of Torino. Faculty, students and staff of the different universities were invited to participate. The debates drew 1,500 unique visitors in three days, 125 registered users and 300 contributions.</p><p>The debates remained open for three days only and proceeded along three tracks. First, a debate on the desirability of becoming an open university. This debate was conducted as part of a discussion forum which users accessed through an interactive map of the debated topics and main arguments (using the Glinkr\u00ae tool). Second, a debate on the definition of an open university (based on the Wheeler Declaration), where participants could edit the Wheeler Declaration and comment on it using the co-ment\u00ae text annotation service. Third, concrete proposals for action were posted by participants and collectively evaluated by means of a graduated scoring technique (the PlonePriori tool).</p><p>At the end of the online debates, Sopinspace produced synthesis documents for each debate track. In parallel, willing participants were invited to act as debate messengers. The role of the debate messengers was to present the results of the online discussions (expressed views and arguments, action proposals, etc) to university decision makers in a physical meeting which concluded the Open University debates. The decision makers were asked to react to the presentations. The Open University project led to some concrete decisions, having the Politecnico di Torino, for instance, committing itself to produce a scoreboard on where it stands in relation to the Wheeler Declaration criteria.</p><p><a id=\"The_Online_Energy_Management_Debate\" name=\"The_Online_Energy_Management_Debate\"></a></p><h3>The Online Energy Management Debate </h3><p>The debate was organized by the French Environment and Energy Demand Management agency, in partnership with NGOs and science communication organizations. While most of the debate was conducted online, relying on thematic/argument cartography tools, it also included face-to-face citizen and stakeholders panels.</p><p>The debate was held between March 2007 and July 2007. Its aim was to produce a structured set of opinions and constructive proposals. Soliciting the largest possible amount was not the primary objective, but it was essential to obtain a fair representation of the diverse approaches, perceptions and proposals. The site had around 30,000 visits, up to 5,000 unique visitors per month, and 1,600 contributions (most of them rather detailed and well written). The exchanges were always courteous and respected the ethics of debate. The debate was largely uncovered by the media, due to the focus of the media on the upcoming elections in France. A better coverage could have attracted to the debate a greater number of participants who lacked prior awareness of environment and energy issues.</p><p>Users who registered on the site (registration was necessary to post contributions, but not for commenting on posts by others) were invited to provided some basic information about themselves. More than 90% of the 435 registered users accepted to do so. The provided data revealed an over-representation of highly-educated participants and an under-representation of blue collar workers. More than 50% of the participants were less than 40 years old and the number of participants aged 18-24 was larger than their share in the general population. The debate benefited from a substantial geographical spread, but only 22% of the participants were women.</p><p>The debate was held in 3 stages. During the first one, Internet users were asked to express their views on why energy demand management does not progress better and to formulate proposals on how to overcome the obstacles related to energy management. This stage involved an innovative use of tools for thematic cartography. These tools allowed the moderators of the debate to map the main themes and arguments of the ongoing discussions and offer participants a synoptical view of the debate. Such maps lowered entry barriers into discussions and facilitated the addition of novel contributions. Moderators from Sopinspace updated the maps as the debate developed (participants could comment and object to these updates). According to Sopinspace, such usage of thematic cartography has proved to be useful for maintaining readability and in order to make possible for contradictory exchanges to develop in certain \u201czones\u201d of the map without preventing other themes to be debated in a constructive manner in other \u201czones\u201d.</p><p>In the second phase, seven multi-stakeholders face-to-face meetings took place in several French cities, bringing together interested citizens, Internet contributors, experts, NGOs, etc. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the proposals that were brought up online and select 32 of them for a further discussion. The third stage consisted of a new online debate, which aimed to better analyze and refine these 32 proposals.</p><p>25 concrete policy or action proposals and 5 discussions without a consensual proposal constituted the outcome of the debate. The latter are on subjects where argumentative exchanges have dominated (primarily on the respective role of renewable energy and nuclear energy for electricity production). 16 of these proposals were sent to decision-makers and included suggestions regarding eco-taxes and direct policies for the transportation field; new incentives for energy saving investments; suggestions regarding a coordinated approach to spatial and city planning, and more. The other proposals were not mature enough and required a further research and discussion.</p><p><a id=\"The_Online_Debate_on_Wind_Turbines\" name=\"The_Online_Debate_on_Wind_Turbines\"></a></p><h3>The Online Debate on Wind Turbines </h3><p>The debate was held between November 2005 and October 2006, as part of the European DREAM 2 project which aims promote the use of ICT in the region of Nord Pas de Calais. The purpose of the debate was to engage the 12,000 residents of Atr\u00e9batie in a discussion on wind energy and its implications for the region. The debate combined an online platform with face-to-face meetings. While the agenda for the debate was developed online, the actual discussion was held in small face-to-face meetings.</p><p>The discussion consisted of four stages. During the first stage, participants suggested issues for the debate's agenda. This stage was based on a free flow of ideas and suggestions. During the second stage, participants were asked to rank the suggestions that were brought up on the first stage. The ranking allowed to limit the variety of the suggested ideas to a set of topics that most significantly concerned the participants. The third stage consisted of face-to-face meetings in groups of 12, based on the topics that were prioritized online. At the fourth stage, the synthesis of the face-to-face meetings along with the responses of the municipality officials were posted online.</p><p>The website remained open for a month and a half, with an average of 40 visitors per day. During the first stage, 40 participants offered 90 issues for discussion and, at the second stage, 60 participants ranked the proposals. The face-to-face meetings drew over one hundred participants. It is not clear which of the proposals were adopted by the municipality.</p><p><a id=\"Further_reading\" name=\"Further_reading\"></a></p><h2>Further reading </h2><p><a id=\"External_Links\" name=\"External_Links\"></a></p><h2>External Links </h2><ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.sopinspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.sopinspace.com\">Sopinspace</a></li><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.debatpublic.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.debatpublic.net\">French speaking Observatory of on-line debates and their tools</a></li><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Aigrain\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Aigrain\">Philippe Aigrain on the Wikipedia</a></li></ul><p><a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-0\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/?page_id=65&amp;lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/?page_id=65&amp;lang=en\">http://www.sopinspace.com/?page_id=65&amp;lang=en</a></li><li id=\"cite_note-1\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.co-ment.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.co-ment.com\">http://www.co-ment.com</a></li><li id=\"cite_note-2\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=934&amp;lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=934&amp;lang=en\">http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=934&amp;lang=en</a></li><li id=\"cite_note-3\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/products/glinkr\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/products/glinkr\">http://www.sopinspace.com/products/glinkr</a></li><li id=\"cite_note-4\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/products/plonepriori\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/products/plonepriori\">http://www.sopinspace.com/products/plonepriori</a></li><li id=\"cite_note-5\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=214&amp;lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=214&amp;lang=en\">http://www.sopinspace.com/?p=214&amp;lang=en</a></li></ol>", "geo_city": "Paris", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Sopinspace", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/sopinspace", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "48\u00b0 51' 6.4584\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "18", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "2\u00b0 22' 40.6848\" E", "fulltime_staff": "6", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2011-12-21T22:09:01", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Tom Steinberg", "post_date": "2009-10-07T07:10:12", "other_images": "[\"Fixmystreet.jpg\", \"Mysociety.png\", \"No-10-petitions-website.jpg.png\", \"Theyworkforyou.jpg\", \"Whatdotheyknow.jpg\", \"Writetothem.jpg\"]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "203", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "United Kingdom", "content_country": "United Kingdom", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Education &amp; Schools||Economic Development||Environment||National &amp; International Security", "body_en": "<p>MySociety.org is a project of a registered charity named UK Citizens Online Democracy.

The ICG also sponsors several speaking engagements, forums, and events aimed at fostering dialogue and encouraging deliberation in order to improve the common good.</p><p><a id=\"Philosophy\" name=\"Philosophy\"></a></p><h3>Philosophy</h3><p>The philosophy of The Institute on the Common Good finds its roots in the teachings of St. Ignatius of Loyola, particularly his three core values: finding God in all things, good intentions, and the will to be changed or transformed by others. Additionally, the ICG's philosophy is further informed by the four key concepts derived from the tradition of Catholic social teaching. These are:</p><ul><li>Human Dignity: The inherent belief in the dignity of the human person.</li><li>Common Good and Community: The human person is both sacred and social, growing and achieving fulfillment only in community.</li><li>Subsidiarity and Participation: Individuals have a right to fully participate in decisions made on issues relevant to them, and giving a voice to the most vulnerable members of society is a key moral duty.</li><li>Rights and Responsibilities: Society can only function if the fullest level of human rights are recognized and members recognize their rights and well as their responsibilities to their own welfare and the welfare of others.<a href=\"#cite_note-The_ICG_Website-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></li></ul><p>The Institute on the Common Good endeavors to merge these philosophical tenets with \"the latest research in the emerging field of dialogue.\"<a href=\"#cite_note-The_ICG_Website-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>The Institute on the Common Good was founded in 1998 by Regis University President Father Michael J. Sheeran, S.J.. Father Sheeran had long sought to create a community outreach arm of the University and thus founded the Institute \"based on his conviction that important issues can be resolved and societal changes can occur if people gather together and speak honestly with one another.\"<a href=\"#cite_note-The_ICG_Website-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>Father Sheeran's interest in dialogue and deliberation originated from his participation in a dialogue between the New York president of the NAACP and several local business and labor leaders at the height of the civil rights movement, in the New York office of the Jesuit magazine America, for which Sheeran worked. Although these groups mistrusted one another, they were able to \"create a set of priorities that helped convince Civil Rights leaders that New York business and labor leaders were committed to working together,\" preventing a potentially violent dispute from erupting.<a href=\"#cite_note-The_ICG_Website-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>In 1993, Father Sheeran hosted the first meeting between President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II. Despite their differences on a whole host of issues, the meeting resulted in an agreement to cooperate on sending aid to Muslim countries, and a promise by the Pope to use his influence to encourage peace in Yugoslavia.</p><p>It was from these two historic experience on the power of dialogue that Father Sheeran gained the impetus to create The Institute on the Common Good.</p><p>Father Richard Dunphy, S.J. was named the Institute\u2019s first director in 1998 and served until 2001. The directorship was then handed over to Dr. Paul Alexander, who is also the director of the Master of Nonprofit Management Master\u2019s degree at Regis University, and serves as director to the present day.</p><p><a id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2><p>The Institute on the Common Good's primary purpose is to provide speaking engagements, forums, and community outreach through the numerous events and initiatives it sponsors each year. Rather than merely researching dialogue and deliberative techniques as an academic exercise the Institute on the Common Good \"is unique in that it actively partners with groups engaged in community life. These projects take many forms and include public and private dialogues, initiatives, educational programs, speakers, and collaboration and partnerships with a large variety of civic and social organizations.\"<a href=\"#cite_note-The_ICG_Website-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Some notable examples include:</p><p><a id=\"Public_Deliberation_Initiative\" name=\"Public_Deliberation_Initiative\"></a></p><h3>Public Deliberation Initiative</h3><p>In the Spring of 2006, The Institute on the Common Good formed a partnership with the Council of Public Policy Education to create the Public Deliberation Initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to \"offer workshops, forums and other activities based on a the National Issues Forums approach to discussing critical community and national issues.\"<a href=\"#cite_note-The_ICG_Website-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Additionally, the Public Deliberation Initiative is aimed at NIF moderator training and working with state, national, and international organizations to create and foster deliberative forums based on the NIF model.</p><p><a id=\"The_Homelessness_Dialogue_Project\" name=\"The_Homelessness_Dialogue_Project\"></a></p><h3>The Homelessness Dialogue Project</h3><p>In September of 2006 The Institute on the Common Good partnered with the Center for Civic Ethics at Denver University and the Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods to create the Homeless Dialogue Project. The purpose of this project was to bring the homed and the homeless together as neighbors to discuss the serious issues surrounding homelessness, and to create a forum through which deliberation about alternative policy options could take place.</p><p><a id=\"Notable_Speakers\" name=\"Notable_Speakers\"></a></p><h3>Notable Speakers</h3><p>In addition to sponsoring forums and initiatives, the Institute on the Common Good seeks to provide the student body of Regis University and the Denver community at large with a diverse range of world-renowned speakers as a fresh avenue of education, and as a means of creating dialogue about important national and international issues. The Institute on the Common Good has made it a tradition to invite Nobel Peace Prize Winners to speak, and, altogether, 13 Nobel laureates have spoken at Regis since 1996. Examples of such speakers include:</p><ul><li>President Lech Walesa, leader of the Polish Solidarity movement,</li><li>Gail Collins, New York Times Columnist,</li><li>Betty Williams of Northern

We are comprised of a network of researchers and practitioners working in research institutions and civil society organisations in seven countries \u2013 Angola, Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa and the UK.</p><p>The aim of the Citizenship DRC is to increase understanding of how to support the efforts of poor and marginalised groups to define and claim their rights. Our seven principal research themes include:</p><p>1. Deepinging Democracy in States and Localities</p><p>2. Local-global Citizen Engagement</p><p>3. Violence, Citizenship and Participation</p><p>4. Spaces for Change? The Politics of Participation in New Democratic Arenas</p><p>5. Realising Rights and Claiming Accountabilities</p><p>6. Meanings and Expressions of Rights and Citizenship</p><p>7. Science and Citizens in a Global Context</p><p><a id=\"Partners\" name=\"Partners\"></a></p><h1>Partners</h1><p>In order to gain a critical understanding of citizenship, participation and accountability in different contexts, the Citizenship DRC works collaboratively through a network of partners from research institutions and civil society organisations in seven countries. Our seven partners include:</p><p>Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Para O Desenvolvimento Rural E Ambiental (ADRA) \u2013 Angola</p><p>BRAC Development Institute (BDI) \u2013 Bangladesh</p><p>Centro Brasileiro de An\u00e1lise e Planejamento (CEBRAP) \u2013 Brazil</p><p>Society for Participatory Research in Asia (PRIA) \u2013 India</p><p>Theatre for Development Centre of Ahmadu Bello University (TFDC) \u2013 Nigeria</p><p>African Centre for Citizenship and Democracy / School of Government of the University of the Western Cape (ACCEDE-UWC) \u2013 South Africa</p><p>Institute of Development Studies (IDS) \u2013 UK</p><p>In addition to the seven core partners, Citizenship DRC has collaborated on various research projects and publications with a number of research associates from an additional 13 countries.</p><p><a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h1>Activities</h1><p>The Citizenship DRC brings together institutional partners to produce and communicate knowledge on the relationship between citizens and their states. It is hoped that this, in turn, will contribute to poverty reduction in partner countries by empowering citizens and by helping state institutions become more capable, accountable and responsive. To meet this goal, the Citizenship DRC carries out three broad activities:</p><p>Research: Since 2001, the Citizenship DRC has produced more than 400 research outputs that examine the effect of citizen action on states and societies. Our research now constitutes ten years\u2019 worth of work that challenges top-down approaches to development that have traditionally neglected local realities. These outputs include journal articles, a nine-volume series with Zed Books entitled \u2018Claiming Citizenship\u2019, working papers and videos, among others. Many of these outputs are available online and all are currently being collected for the production of a DVD-ROM that encapsulates the programme\u2019s entire research and policy work.</p><p>Capacity building: Building research capacity within the Citizenship DRC has been embedded in the consortium\u2019s ways of working since 2001. The decentralisation of research coordination efforts has contributed to a shared sense of ownership amongst partners. Research partners come together annually in research meetings and workshops to share their research experiences and findings. This has facilitated innovations in new methodologies and the development of new analytical frameworks. In addition to building research capacities, the Citizenship DRC has also developed its network to include projects on teaching and learning citizenship; sustaining and increasing research funding; and communicating research findings to wider audiences.</p><p>Communication and policy influencing: Through its integrated approach to research and communication, the Citizenship DRC has designed a range of strategies for working with local and international stakeholders. Using a variety of policy mapping techniques, we have increased our capacity to effectively use varied communication mediums to inform relevant policy debates. Most recently, our partners\u2019 research has informed the redesign of the indigenous health service in Brazil and been used in high-level discussions in the presidential commission for electoral reform in Nigeria, among others.</p><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h1>Funding</h1><p>The Citizenship DRC receives principal funding from the UK Department for International Development.</p><p><a id=\"Sample_of_Key_Publications\" name=\"Sample_of_Key_Publications\"></a></p><h1>Sample of Key Publications</h1><p>Cornwall, A and V Schattan P Coelho (eds) (2007) Spaces for Change?

At the moment, it operates as an adhocracy (modeled after the typical open source software project), though it is working on using the software of member projects to act as its governance mechanism.\n</p><p>The intention of the project is to build governance software which is to be adopted first in small communities. From there, they intend to study the implementation, collect feedback, and adapt the software such that it can spread outward with the potential to gradually replace many institutions of representative democracy with a new kind of social organization called <a href=\"/methods/collaborative-governance\" title=\"Collaborative Governance\">Collaborative Governance</a>.\n</p>\n\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>While there is little information available on the origins of the Metagovernment project--even on its own website--open source governance first appeared in the early 1980s as part of a computer-based research project on <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Online_deliberation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Online deliberation (page does not exist)\">online deliberation</a> and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Deliberative_democracy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Deliberative democracy (page does not exist)\">deliberative democracy</a>. \n</p><p>Other small examples of open source government and collaborative democratic mechanisms appeared in the early 21st Century as Internet technology drastically improved and usage boomed. Many of the first methods were an effort to create a citizens' forum for elections and public opinion. The <a href=\"http://greenparty.ca/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://greenparty.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Party of Canada</a>, for example, created what it referred to as a \"living platform\" to compile the opinions of Canadian citizens and policy experts to ensure a very well-represented platform for the entire party.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Specializations_and_activities\" id=\"Specializations_and_activities\"></a><h2>Specializations and activities</h2>\n<p>As the organization is still in its early years, the activities currently primarily focus on growing the information present on the website as well as its influence.

At this time, all but one of these are free and open source software.\nThe member projects range from software tools intended to build consensus and facilitate decision-making, to ones which are intended to act as stand-alone governance mechanisms. As of February 2010, most of the projects are, roughly, in a beta stage of development, and have not been deployed substantially. However, the Metagovernment project itself has used several of the participating software tools to make decisions internal to the community.\n</p><p>The member projects are active and created by members of the metagovernment project for the members' benefit and to advance the capabilities of collaborative democracy. \n</p>\n<a name=\"Adhocracy\" id=\"Adhocracy\"></a><h3>Adhocracy</h3>\n<p>Adhocracy is a drafting and delegated voting tool for small and medium-sized groups. It is one of the active projects of the Metagoverment project. It is a free and open source software project following a standard three-section BSD-style license. It uses a liquid democracy software website, and in Adhocracy, individuals choose to act as NGOs, initiatives or corporations to network through democratic principles and processes to formulate goals, strategies and internal rules to develop positions on issues. It is a practical implementation of direct parliamentary systems.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Candiwi\" id=\"Candiwi\"></a><h3>Candiwi</h3>\n<p>Candiwi (formerly Metascore) is the name of the software which can administer any community wishing to govern itself through collaborative governance and is currently in the alpha development stage. It uses a scoring system to evaluate resolutions.\n</p>\n<a name=\"DemocracyLab\" id=\"DemocracyLab\"></a><h3>DemocracyLab</h3>\n<p>DemocracyLab is an experiment in direct democracy, powered by open source software, and built on the idea that technology can empower individuals to harness freedom of speech and the power of the vote to solve today\u2019s most challenging problems.\n</p><p>It uses participants\u2019 posts and votes to build a dynamic map of political thought designed to facilitate consensus and solve problems. The result is an engaging public forum where the best thinking rises to the top, creating a community-driven alternative to traditional politics.\n</p><p>DemocracyLab is a transparent and collaborative work in progress.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Dynamic_Democracy\" id=\"Dynamic_Democracy\"></a><h3>Dynamic Democracy</h3>\n<p>Dynamic Democracy is a ranking engine for users to submit and vote on \"bills\" that they wish the government was considering. The organization neither vet submissions nor actually campaigns on them. Instead it allows anyone post freely and anonymously to see what information and ideas arise. \n</p><p>The site came about in the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2010/ukpga_20100024_en_1\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2010/ukpga_20100024_en_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digital Economy Bill</a> fiasco in the UK - when it became clear that the government really doesn't address the public's issues very well. The organizers wanted to see what the government would be talking about if the citizens were the government. In that way, it is an online program similar to the <a href=\"/wiki/Countywide_Community_Forums_(of_King_County)\" title=\"Countywide Community Forums (of King County)\">Countywide Community Forums (of King County)</a>.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Eudemocracia\" id=\"Eudemocracia\"></a><h3>Eudemocracia</h3>\n<p>Eudemocracia is an Argentinian NGO. It has the same overall mission as Metagovernment (online collaborative government), but it makes its primary focus activism rather than just pure deliberation.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Indaba_Application_Network\" id=\"Indaba_Application_Network\"></a><h3>Indaba Application Network</h3>\n<p>The Indaba Application Network is the platform running 'WeVote' (on Facebook) and 'ChoiceRanker'\n</p>\n<a name=\"NationBuilder\" id=\"NationBuilder\"></a><h3>NationBuilder</h3>\n<p>NationBuilder is a member project of the Metagovernment project. It is the foundation of <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse2.org/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse2.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White House 2</a>, which is a web platform for American citizens to (unofficially) collectively act as the White House decision-makers. There is a similar program available in <a href=\"http://parliament2.ca/priorities/top\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://parliament2.ca/priorities/top\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"http://skuggathing.is/portal\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://skuggathing.is/portal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iceland</a> and <a href=\"http://au.nationbuilder.com/priorities/top\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://au.nationbuilder.com/priorities/top\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australia</a> \n</p>\n<a name=\"Openpolitics\" id=\"Openpolitics\"></a><h3>Openpolitics</h3>\n<p>Openpolitics is a Canadian issues based approach to public deliberation that developed as a result of the living platform project (Green Party of Canada). Activity is on hiatus as owner/founder Michael Pilling focuses on personal goals, but supporters are hopeful that the group can provide a \"bigger solution\" which draws input from multiple organizations and websites.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Telematics_Freedom_Foundation\" id=\"Telematics_Freedom_Foundation\"></a><h3>Telematics Freedom Foundation</h3>\n<p>The Telematics Freedom Foundation has the general goal of furthering democracy, including media and global democracy, through the promotion of telematic solutions that enable the protection and extention of the communication and participation rights of all people.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Vilfredo_goes_to_Athens\" id=\"Vilfredo_goes_to_Athens\"></a><h3>Vilfredo goes to Athens</h3>\n<p>The Vilfredo Goes To Athens project starts from the research of what would happen from a mathematical point of view if the principle \"without consensus there is no law\" were in fact truth and seriously considered. It also assumes that in many case there is a possible solution out there that would generate the consensus. Sometimes key individuals (often regarded as leaders) would find this solution by speaking with the various parts. This program software is trying to help the discussant by showing where the key differences are. It seeks to help people find their own solutions without the need of a deified leader, as such leaders eventually can become a burden themselves. \n</p>\n<a name=\"Virtual_Parliament\" id=\"Virtual_Parliament\"></a><h3>Virtual Parliament</h3>\n<p>The Virtual Parliament is a UK based website that allows the public to vote on existing policies from political parties, and also suggest their own.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Votorola\" id=\"Votorola\"></a><h3>Votorola</h3>\n<p>Votorola is a member project of the Metagovernment project. It is a software designed for building consensus and reaching decisions in public. Installed in a local town or region, nationwide or worldwide, it functions as a primary rule-making system for the open proposal, refinement and selection of candidate laws, plans and policies. It also functions as a primary electoral system, one in which candidates are chosen by open, cross-party consensus. The backbone of the system is a peer-to-peer voting mechanism that allows for recursive delegation, unrestricted nomination, and continuous vote shifting. The voter lists are authenticated by a neighbourhood trust network.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Votetocracy\" id=\"Votetocracy\"></a><h3>Votetocracy</h3>\n<p>Votetocracy is a site which allows citizens to vote on bills before the United States Congress and send votes to their representatives. Citizen's votes are tallied against the votes of Congress and displayed as agreements or disagreements. It acts essentially as a rating system for Congressional members and a path to a different kind of governance.\nIn addition to the above, version 2 will allow organizations, lobby groups, and others rally their members and Votetocracy members. The project is building an internet-wide platform that organizations can embed in their own sites to tap into the Votetocracy system. The ultimate goal is to combine the collective efforts of citizens and organizations into one voice with measurable outcomes and comparisons versus the decisions made in Congress.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>A direct budget number for the metagovernment project was not found, however, they explicitly state their political/philosophical stance on funding on their website:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\"In collaborative governance systems, proposals should be self-funding. If a tax or other fund-raising measure is needed to implement a proposal, it should be accounted for in the language of the proposal, and not forbidden by a higher level of government.\nPerhaps there can be a minimalist central funding authority in each community to administer the accounting of the money, but the actual funding mechanism should be part of the proposal. There should always be a fundamental bias against giving power to central funding authorities, and all such authorities should exist at the whim of their associated community website.\" <a href=\"http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Funding\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Funding\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a> </blockquote> \n<a name=\"Criticism\" id=\"Criticism\"></a><h2>Criticism</h2>\n<p>In an online forum discussing the future of the metagovernment project using <a href=\"http://gmane.org/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://gmane.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gname Loom</a>, some of the participants appear optimistic about this umbrella organization and its member projects, but there is also tremendous criticism of its effectiveness in achieving the goals outlined in the Metagovernment project's <a href=\"http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mission and Vision page</a>. One participant, Patrick Anderson, voiced a concern that because there is no opt-out mechanism, metagovernment's goal of consensus building--with regards to funding--means that:\n</p>\n<blockquote> With traditional taxation, I am 'required' to help pay for that construction unless I can get a majority of others to complain that it is not needed because I already paid taxes into an untargeted \"slush fund\". I cannot opt-out unless I group with others to opt-out.  If I 'win' by stopping construction, it causes others to 'lose' because they DID want to fund the project. <a href=\"http://www.evri.com/media/article?title=Gmane+Loom&amp;page=http://news.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/cutoff%3D2728&amp;referring_uri=/news/for?query%3Dmetagovernment&amp;referring_title=Evri\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.evri.com/media/article?title=Gmane+Loom&amp;page=http://news.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/cutoff%3D2728&amp;referring_uri=/news/for?query%3Dmetagovernment&amp;referring_title=Evri\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a> </blockquote> \n<p>A system of metagovernment relates back to general criticisms of direct democracy that have been around for thousands of years, primarily the notion of mob rule or <a href=\"http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=mobocracy\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=mobocracy\" rel=\"nofollow\">mobocracy</a>, only furthered by the aforementioned instance of opt-out vs. opt-in funding. \n</p><p>Plato in The Republic wrote that, \"Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike.\" <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7S5rBCF9HIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=republic+of+plato&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=1cwITNubGYHQkwTpkMCADQ&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7S5rBCF9HIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=republic+of+plato&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=1cwITNubGYHQkwTpkMCADQ&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a> Democracy appears to be a short-term system full of disorder and instability. Consensus building takes time during which solutions could have been implemented by a unilateral decision and corruption is possible with vote buying. Just as non-participation implies consent in metagovernment, consensus building implies compromise and the potential for minority opinions to be coerced into accepting the majority rule.

We are reinventing public consultation</strong></p><p>MASS is best known for its innovative approach to public engagement and consultation. First, we believe that public consultation is a form of cultural production. Success depends on the design choices our clients make when they create opportunities for members of the public to interact with and advise government.\u00a0\u00a0Since 2007, we have conducted twenty-five major reference panels, citizens\u2019 assemblies and commissions for government, tackling some of the toughest and most divisive issues in public policy today. We also routinely host national, provincial and regional conversations, inviting Canadians to think about their country's future and their priorities for investment and reform.</p><p>Creating publics: Introducing the Civic Lottery</p><p>Working with Canada Post, MASS mails tens of thousands of Canadian households each year inviting residents to volunteer to serve on one of several reference panels or commission. Civic Lotteries produce random-representative cohorts that contain a wide range of perspectives and can speak for their communities. MASS is a global leader in the use of sortition to engage citizens in democratic processes.</p><p>Convening publics: Introducing the Reference Panel</p><p>Reference Panels are typically comprised of thirty-six randomly-selected residents who meet over several days to advise government on a specific policy issue. With an explicit mandate, these panels provide a deliberative forum in each to learn about a complex issue from leading experts and with the assistance of trained facilitators, find common ground. MASS has pioneered the design and use of Reference Panels to inform public policy choices in Canada.</p><p><strong>2. We develop ambitious strategies that enjoy public support</strong></p><p>Strategy isn't only about getting from A to B. Much as we might like to pretend, when it comes to aligning divergent priorities, or getting clear about an organization's core values, there are no straight lines. This is especially true for public sector organizations which work to juggle changing political contexts, fiscal constraints, and the competing interests of stakeholders and communities.\u00a0We work with our clients develop strategies for organizations that are serious about change. \u00a0We approach strategy as a collaborative process that helps to establish priorities and new goals.\u00a0\u00a0We want to help our clients to raise their sights, strengthen their relationships, and reach agreement from first principles.\u00a0Currently, our Strategy Practice works in two fields: first,\u00a0to develop multi-year strategic plans and secondly, to develop engagement strategies that assist organizations to better integrate effective engagement techniques within existing governance and communications frameworks.<br />\u00a0</p><p><strong>3. We deliver solid research that shapes good choices</strong></p><p>MASS provides policy-related research services to clients across many sectors. We routinely conduct wide-ranging environmental scans, prepare case studies and provocation papers, interview experts and stakeholders, commission essays from thoughtleaders and host workshops to review our findings or carry a discussion forward. Whatever the approach, our clients turn to us to provide insight, creativity and breadth, and to provide clear evidence and strong examples they can use to make their case. Using our knowledge of different policy areas and the state-of-play in different jurisdictions we help our clients to map out what's possible.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Inspired by Canada's first Citizens' Assemblies, MASS LBP was founded in 2007 by Peter MacLeod and George Gosbee to extend this model and reinvent public consultation.\u00a0</p>To date, MASS has conducted twenty-five major reference panels, citizens assemblies and commissions for government involving more than 1000 Canadians, and reaching 250,000 households. Cumulatively, this represents some 30,000 hours of deliberation on significant public issues, making MASS an internationally-recognized and unparalleled leader in the design and delivery of deliberative processes for government.\u00a0In addition, we provide a range of services to public sector organizations including strategic planning and communications, custom research, facilitation and hosting, as well as event coordination and logistics.<h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Our services include:</p><ul><li>Comprehensive process design and delivery \u2013 from 20 to 200+ participants</li><li>Strategic advice concerning effective engagement</li><li>Corporate and public needs assessment</li><li>Program evaluation and analysis</li><li>Custom research and dissemination</li><li>Facilitation teams</li><li>Public communications and curriculum development</li><li>Event coordination and logistics</li></ul><p>MASS LBP's principal methods are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/civic-lottery\">Civic\u00a0Lottery</a></li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-reference-panel\">Citizens' Reference Panel</a></li></ul>MASS LBP is a highly collaborative organization that we think works better and smarter when we're open and honest about money. We know the value of a dollar and the importance of conducting our business in full public view. There are only two salary levels at MASS. We are fortunate to work on projects often funded with public monies and we want our clients and citizen-participants to know where we stand \u2013 and we think that includes knowing what we earn.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, senior staff with one year of service earn $80,000 per year. Junior staff earn $60,000. Part-time staff earn either of the two rates on a pro-rata basis. Why disclose our salaries? Because it seems like the right thing to do.

This is underpinned by the conviction that a random selection of everyday citizens are more than capable of navigating and making decisions about complex political issues. As founder Luca Belgiorno-Nettis (2013) <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/founder-s-messages/202-founder-s-message\">puts it</a>:</p><p><em>Our focus is on everyday people being randomly selected to deliberate and see if a consensus view can be reached. I am willing to trust these people because of the diversity of skills in the community, and the fact they are beyond the reach of so many impairments we place on the judgment of the representatives we elect today. They have no political donations, no factions, no pre-selections to worry about, no special interest groups to campaign against them, no lobbyists with connections to them, no faceless men looming in the background! </em></p><p>nDF\u2019s approach is firmly underpinned by deliberative democratic theory. In creating deliberative spaces \u2013 such as the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/australias-first-citizens-parliament-canberra-australia\">Australian Citizens\u2019 Parliament</a> \u2013 the foundation aims to contribute to a future deliberative community as envisaged by prominent scholars (see for example Gastil 2007; Parkinson 2015). Indeed, since newDemocracy\u2019s inception in 2004, deliberative democracy scholars have begun to look to the idea of \u2018deliberative systems\u2019 as a way of conceptualising deliberative democracy writ large (eg. Dryzek 2009) . In many ways nDF was ahead of the game when they launched; their original objectives were, through the creation of deliberative spaces, to promote a broader shift towards a more participatory, consensus-based political system. This is in sharp contrast to the adversarial, polarising rhetoric of Australian party politics.</p><p>newDemocracy is now well established in Australia as one of the foremost practitioners of deliberative democracy. They are particularly well-known for expertise in the recruitment process and facilitation of citizens\u2019 juries, as their body of work attests. nDF also retains its original commitment to changing Australia\u2019s political system for the better, through establishing effective mechanisms for everyday people to deliberate and make public decisions. This is reflected in their advocacy for a <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/alternatives/structural/99-a-citizens-senate\">Citizens\u2019 Senate</a> \u2013 with a House of randomly selected citizens performing the review function of the Upper House. This is \u2018the pragmatic option for a step toward a non-partisan and deliberative parliament.\u2019</p><p>The Citizens\u2019 Senate is one of several <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/alternatives/structural/99-a-citizens-senate\">structural alternatives</a> advocated by nDF for improving how politics is done in Australia. These include Demarchy, and Electronic Townhall and a Citizens\u2019 Legislature. The structural alternatives suggested are grounded in academic research and offer a vision for a different type of politics. Alongside this they also argue in favour of a raft of<a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/alternatives/incremental\"> incremental alternatives</a> \u2013 improvements that could be made to the current political system as it stands.\u00a0</p><h2>History</h2><p>nDF was founded in 2004 by Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, who <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/founder-s-messages/202-founder-s-message\">\u2018wanted to find out if innovation in democracy was possible. It is.\u2019</a> newDemocracy\u2019s inception was a considered response against the often toxic, tit-for-tat character of partisan politics in Australia. nDF advocated a real alternative to this in their support for deliberative democratic processes that gave ordinary people the time, space and relevant information to deliberate on the current political system and how it could be improved.</p><p>This alternative approach became tangible reality with the first Australian Citizens\u2019 Parliament in 2009, funded by nDF and the Australian Research Council. The focus of the process \u2013 involving 150 randomly selected Australians \u2013 was to deliberate on how Australian\u2019s political system could be strengthened to better serve its citizens.</p><p>Since the Citizens\u2019 Parliament, nDF have become perhaps best known for their expertise in random selection and the organisation and facilitation of mini-publics. They have been commissioned by local councils and state governments across four states to run deliberative processes on diverse topics \u2013 from electoral reform to local infrastructure. In addition to running deliberative forums, nDF advocates deliberative democratic approaches \u2013 in particular the citizens\u2019 jury model \u2013 directly to state and federal government through its submissions to various committees.</p><h2><strong>Specializations and Activities</strong></h2><p>A random selection of citizens in a jury format \u2013 a citizens\u2019 jury \u2013 is central to newDemocracy\u2019s approach to improving the democratic process. The following information is summarised from the <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury\">nDF website</a> and describes their overall approach:</p><p><em>Random Selection:</em></p><p>Governments inevitably hear from the noisiest voices who insist on being heard. In contrast, society trusts 12 randomly-selected people on a criminal jury to assess evidence, discuss their views and reach a consensus recommendation because random selection generates \u201cpeople like us\u201d. Our process gets beyond the enraged and the articulate because the public would perceive them as having a bias.</p><p><em>Time:</em></p><p>Most policy problems which warrant the investment in a jury will be complex topics, so we need to allow people the time to educate and immerse themselves in the topic. Faced with a clear remit and a worthwhile level of authority citizens will invest the time.</p><p><em>Information:</em></p><p>Neutrality of information is a core principle, and we are careful to alert all juries that all writers have their own bias and perspective and they need to critically analyse this. To counter the view that \u201cyou can find an expert to say anything\u201d we focus the start of a process on asking \u201cwhat do you need to know\u2026 and who would you trust to inform you\u201d \u2013 and use this as a way of selecting the speakers and input for subsequent jury meetings.</p><p><em>Clear remit:</em></p><p>A plain English question, phrased neutrally is essential.</p><p><em>Upfront authority:</em></p><p>To get everyday people in the room making a considerable time commitment, they need to know that the recommendations they reach mean something and won\u2019t be consumed within the bureaucracy.</p><p><em>Operation:</em></p><p>For the purposes of shifting the mindset from adversarial, two-party, either/or contests, nDF recommends an 80% supermajority be required for a final decision from the jury. In practice, they rarely need to go to a vote and decisions are frequently unanimous, however minority views can be recorded and noted in reports as the objective is to most accurately reflect the view of the room.</p><p><em>How do we randomly select participants?</em></p><p>nDF directly undertakes the jury selection process to ensure there is the highest public confidence in the rigour and independence of the randomisation of invitations. Random selection is the key tool used to identify a range of participants who meet a descriptively representative sample of the community. We match participants to Census data by the key variables of age and gender, and others as each project requires. This is not claimed as a perfect method, but it delivers a more representative sample than any other process.</p><p>We post invitations to a random sample of physical addresses (not billing addresses) drawn from land titles information or Australia Post databases. This ensures that tenants and those not on electoral rolls are reached \u2013 in short, the widest possible catchment. Recipients of the invitation are asked to register online to indicate that they are available for the final selection. Based on those available, a second random draw is done which seeks to randomly match to the age and gender numbers required. This draw generates the final membership of the jury.</p><p>nDF does not provide any juror information to the governments or agencies with which we work.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p><p>Since its inception in 2004, nDF has sought to improve and innovate with its work. nDF-commissed <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/docs/activeprojects/safesydney2014/nDF%20final%20report_May2015.pdf\">research conducted by the Institute for Sustainable Futures</a> in 2015 found that stakeholders did not always feel they understood the deliberative process and for some, this led to disengagement. In response to this, nDF now includes stakeholder engagement as a key component in all of its research designs. This includes stakeholder briefings prior to the process beginning, identifying key stakeholders to present to a jury or panel, as well as offering jurors the opportunity to select stakeholders of their own choosing to present information. This is alongside witnesses chosen by the commissioning body (eg. council) and submissions from the wider community.</p><p><strong>Major projects and events</strong></p><p>nDF has been responsible for over 20 deliberative processes, consultations and policy submissions. Their first major project was the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/australias-first-citizens-parliament-canberra-australia\">Australian Citizens\u2019 Parliament</a> in 2009 which brought together 150 citizens from around the country.</p><p>Other major projects include the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/city-melbourne-peoples-panel\">City of Melbourne People\u2019s Panel</a> in 2014, which involved a broad community engagement process alongside a citizens\u2019 jury to contribute to Melbourne\u2019s 10-year financial plan. nDF also led on two juries in <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/city-sydney-safe-and-vibrant-nightlife\">Sydney</a> and <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/creating-safe-and-vibrant-adelaide-nightlife\">Adelaide</a> on creating a safe and vibrant nightlife.</p><p>nDF\u2019s full body of work \u2013 along with reports, project designs and government responses can be found <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/our-work\">here</a>.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>nDF is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation and relies primarily on <a href=\"http://www.newdemocracy.com.au/get-involved/funding\">donors</a> for its income and has received major donations from the Anita and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis Foundation and Google Australia. In addition, the foundation is commissioned by government and others to run various projects, which are budgeted on a cost recovery basis and vary project to project.</p><p>nDF also funds research into deliberative democracy more broadly.

Using broad-based community organising and leadership traning, it enables people to identify and meet their needs, so that they can participate more fully in local regeneration processes, in the development of effective local and national urban policy, and society in general.</p><p>Changemakers will allow local people to address issues not being tackled in other ways. These organisations will be large, diverse, disciplined, and led by ordinary local people who have been trained in community leadership. Changemakers represents an attempt to set direct, participatory forms of democratic activity alongside representative ones. The programme is responding to widespread apathy and cynicism about politics and citizen engagement. It is a way of enabling the poorest and most marginalised communities to have a voice at the table of power by claiming their own political spaces. <a id=\"Specializations_and_activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and activities</h2><p>The idea of Broad Based Organising is to build up community groups and to develop leadership skills. It is a values based process where people are brought together to act in the interest of their communities and the common good.

Their aim is to involve citizens in public decision making. They work with a variety of organizations, from government to private sector. Involve makes a practical difference by delivering the highest quality public participation processes possible as well as undertaking rigorous research and policy analysis into what works.</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Involve was founded in 2003 by Richard Wilson to determine how new forms of public participation in government can strengthen democracy in Britain. Involve has its office in Central London.\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Specializations_and_activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and activities</h2><p>Involve has four main specializations:</p><ul><li>Advocacy: making the case for genuine citizen empowerment;</li><li>New Thinking: improving understanding of what works;</li><li>Better practice: supporting institutions and citizens;</li><li>Networking: bringing member of the participation and empowerment field together.</li></ul><p>Through these specializations, Involve has transformed how leading public bodies and companies engage, including: Shell International, the OECD, Ministry of Justice, the European Commission, the States of Jersey (not New), the Sustainable Development Commission, the BBC and many more local and regional governments.</p><p><a id=\"Major_Projects_and_events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects and events</h2><p>Involve's major projects can be sorted in to five categories: Unlocking citizen participation, citizen participation in challenging issues, embedding public engagement in government, public engagement with fewer resources, and promoting good practice.</p><p><a id=\"Unlocking_Citizen_Participation\" name=\"Unlocking_Citizen_Participation\"></a></p><h3>Unlocking Citizen Participation</h3><p>The goal of unlocking citizen participation is to explore what it is that citizens need in order to actively participate in their own communities. Past projects include Scouting Sunday, Involve and I&amp;DeA Informal Engagement in Health Guidance, and Say&amp;Play, a project meant to improve local government consultation by combining a community fun day with appropriate consultation methods. Currently they are working on Pathways through Participation, a lottery funded project exploring how and why people get involved and stay involved in different forms of participation throughout their lives.</p><p><a id=\"Citizen_Participation_in_Challenging_Issues\" name=\"Citizen_Participation_in_Challenging_Issues\"></a></p><h3>Citizen Participation in Challenging Issues</h3><p>To encourage citizen participation in challenging issues, Involve carries out research and develops new practices exploring how citizens can be engaged in complex technical or political debates to help decide a collaborative solution. Past projects include The European Citizens' Consultation 2009, a 3 stage deliberation event where citizens from all over Europe were assembled to deliberate on the economic and social future of Europe. Currently they are working on putting together the Alberta Climate Dialogue, a similar event that will take place in Canada.</p><p><a id=\"Embedding_Public_Engagement_in_Government\" name=\"Embedding_Public_Engagement_in_Government\"></a></p><h3>Embedding Public Engagement in Government</h3><p>Involve projects with the goal of embedding public engagement in government focus on helping inwardly focused organizations to become more open to citizen involvement. A past success was Engaging With Impact, a joint project between Involve and MASS LBP, a Canadian engagement innovator. The project examined the culture of engagement across Ontario's public health system, culminating in a report identifying indicators than can be used to improve public and patient engagement in the health area. Currently they are working on a project called Armchair Involvement where they conduct desk research, interviews, workshops and field research to identify the types of digital tools that are useful in encouraging patient and public involvement.</p><p><a id=\"Public_Engagement_with_Fewer_Resources\" name=\"Public_Engagement_with_Fewer_Resources\"></a></p><h3>Public Engagement with Fewer Resources</h3><p>Public engagement with fewer resources is aimed at discovering techniques to make getting citizens involved more efficient and effective. Involve conducts research to evaluate where public engagement can add value, and how to reduce government costs and make more effective decisions. An ongoing project is the Valuing Public Engagement project, a collaboration with Consumer Focus England to develop an equation for identifying costs and benefits associated with public engagement. They are also currently working on Efficiency Savings Through Engagement, where Involve provides a number of activities such as auditing current engagement activities, delivering a wide array of cost effective training, and building internal capacity through training and mentoring.</p><p><a id=\"Promote_Good_Practice\" name=\"Promote_Good_Practice\"></a></p><h3>Promote Good Practice</h3><p>Involve also tries to promote good practice of engagement activities in order to encourage others to participate. Their most notable project in this aspect was to prepare a guide and provide mentorship for the MOPAN staff outlining how to design and run effective dialogues with citizens. MOPAN is the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network is a group of 14 donor nations surveying and assessing multilateral organizations in developing countries.<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.involve.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.involve.org.uk/\">[1]</a></p><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>Involve is a not for profit organization that receives funding from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation.

The research found that women were under-represented in political decision-making in the city , particularly at higher levels. Dissemination of the findings led to advocacy work and development of training programmes to help address some of the needs and gaps identified. These included greater general understanding of gender equality issues within the community, voluntary and public sectors, and confidence building for women, who were generally less comfortable than men in formal public meetings.</p><p>The GEM Project team set up the GAP Unit in response to a high demand for advice and training from local and regional organisations, big and small. They also wanted to be able to provide support to grassroots women\u2019s groups, through self-esteem and empowerment projects and other activities based on the principles of participatory community education. <a id=\"Specializations_and_activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and activities</h2><p>GAP unit specialises in the following areas Community development, Research and consultancy (using a variety of participatory research methods) as well as Training (in Gender, diversity and inequality; Capacity building; Research methods; and Empowerment sessions). <a id=\"External_Links\" name=\"External_Links\"></a></p><h2>External Links</h2><p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.gapunit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.gapunit.org/\">GAP Unit</a></p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "GAP Unit", "methods": "Community Auditing", "path": "/organizations/gap-unit", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "53\u00b0 28' 13.9332\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "53", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "2\u00b0 15' 44.046\" W", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "University or Research", "updated_date": "2011-12-14T00:54:02", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Fiona Booth", "post_date": "2010-04-20T09:44:55", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "223", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "United Kingdom", "content_country": "United Kingdom", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p><a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a></p><h2>Mission and Purpose</h2><p>The Hansard Society is a UK independent, non-partisan political research and education charity.

Their first members were Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee, and since then the Prime Minister of the day and leaders of the main opposition parties have publicly supported the work of the Hansard Society. The Speaker of the House of Commons is the President of the Hansard Society and the leaders of the three major political parties are our Vice Presidents.</p><p>From its inception the Hansard Society has promoted the importance of political education in schools and among their most well-known activities are their Mock Elections, which provide an informative and hands-on way for young people to gain a taste of the electoral process. This work has developed over the years to include forums and debates held online to enable engagement with young people through the use of new technology. The Hansard Society's pioneering work in schools led to what is now called Citizenship Education and they continue to ensure that teachers have free access to knowledge, training sessions and stimulating resources.</p><p>Since the 1970s the Hansard Society has organised and published research on many aspects of parliamentary democracy, critically examining social and political developments that affect Parliament, seeking to provide authoritative analysis of problems and suggest practical improvements. One important mechanism for this has been the establishment of independent Commissions of Enquiry chaired by eminent parliamentarians or academics. These have included pioneering work on electoral reform, representation of women, reform of the legislative process and the role of scrutiny in Parliament.</p><p>In 1985 the Hansard Society established the prestigious Hansard Scholars and Hansard Research Scholars Programmes in association with the London School of Economics. These programmes attract future political leaders from across the globe, to study and work in Westminster. Since it's creation, the study programme has expanded to include training for charities, journalists, companies and other organisations that need to understand how the parliamentary system works. The innovative and forward thinking eDemocracy Programme was created in 1997 to explore the possibilities, through research and pilot projects, for greater connections between new technologies and politics. The Programme focuses on ways in which democratic institutions can adapt to an age defined by digital communications and how new technology can improve public engagement with politics.In 2000 the Hansard Society extended its work to include issues of devolution and an office in Scotland was set up to respond to the changing political circumstances in British politics. The Hansard Society Scotland Programme holds fringe events at the Scottish National Party's Conference and provides a platform for debate about issues relating to devolution and the Scottish Parliament. It also provides free resources on Citizenship Education to Scottish schools and has recently expanded to include a Hansard Society Scotland Scholars programme in association with the University of Edinburgh.</p><p>More than 60 years on, the Hansard Society is recognised as an independent and non-partisan authority on Parliament and democracy. Today, their work encompasses a wide range of areas, from citizenship education to the role of Parliament, from devolution to the impact of new media on politics. In addition, they organise events in Westminster with high-profile speakers, host influential seminars and hold popular fringe events at Party Conferences. <a id=\"External_Links\" name=\"External_Links\"></a></p><h2>External Links</h2><p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/\">Hansard Society</a></p>", "geo_city": "London", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Hansard Society", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/hansard-society", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "51\u00b0 30' 52.6428\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "53", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 6' 53.532\" W", "fulltime_staff": "22", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2011-12-14T00:55:36", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Elke Loeffler", "post_date": "2010-04-20T11:07:46", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "224", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Birmingham, UK", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p><a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a></p><h2>Mission and Purpose</h2><p>Governance International helps agencies to achieve outcomes for citizens through excellence in public governance.

Their alliance works to share information, build knowledge and visibility, and effectively promote a citizen voice in government decision-making processes.  Fundamental to the DDC\u2019s work is the belief that the outcomes of deliberation result in qualitatively better and longer lasting decisions on policy matters, and that participation in deliberative opportunities is vital to reviving democracy. The DDC has set out on an impressive research agenda that aims to build knowledge around the actual impact of deliberation on civic attitudes and behavior. Their hypothesis is that: \u201cwith expanded application, increased frequency and greater visibility, deliberative democracy can invigorate and rekindle the civic virtues of trust, participation and responsibility.\u201d  More or less, the DDC feels that democratic deliberation is an influential, transformational experience for everyone involved, which can shift people\u2019s attitudes toward the institutions and practice of democracy overall.\n</p><p>The Consortium has committed to the following goals <a href=\"#cite_note-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\u00a0:\n</p><p>-Help public leaders find the examples and resources they need to engage citizens\n</p><p>-Integrate research and practice in the field\n</p><p>-Integrate online and face-to-face approaches\n</p><p>-Articulate how democracy is changing\n</p><p>-Help to build a permanent infrastructure for deliberative democracy\n</p><p>-Encourage research and practice to support all aspects of deliberative democracy\n</p><p>-Design of, and experimentation with, innovative deliberative practices \n</p><p>-Develop evaluation models and tools\n</p><p>-Relationship building, collaboration and convening within the field\n</p><p>-Create connections between the field of deliberation and other related fields\n</p><p>-Disseminate results to the public, decision-makers, academics, etc.\n</p><p>-Promote the philosophy and methods of deliberative democracy to all levels of government\n</p><p>-Increase the credibility and visibility of the deliberative democracy movement in the United States and around the world\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>The DDC was founded in 2002 by leading organizations in the field of deliberative democracy.

KB is led by Archon Fung (Harvard University) and Peter Levine (CIRCLE). The KB Task Group has organized three Researcher and Practitioner Workshops in 2003, 2005, and 2007. The mission of this group is to \u201cincrease the quantity, quality and availability of knowledge about the theory and practice of deliberative democracy through: (1) setting the scholarly research agenda, (2) conducting high-quality research and experimentation on deliberative democratic practices, and (3) collecting and distributing knowledge about theory and practice to researchers and practitioners.\u201d\n</p><p>Major goals the KB task group has identified are:\n-Increase academic research and experimentation on deliberative democratic practices and shape the agenda for that research and experimentation.\n</p><p>-Expand discussion of such experiments in scholarly work on deliberation and democracy.\n</p><p>-Improve knowledge and understanding of how deliberative democratic institutions function, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of various models.\n</p><p>-Increase information about the outcomes of deliberative processes and highlight their value to various constituencies.

The LTG was formed to identify opportunities and come up with strategies to promote and support citizen deliberation in government decision-making.  This task group includes representatives from the Centers for Disease Control, the EPA, and international organizations such as the Danish Board of Technology. Presently, the LTG is working to bring together civic engagement resources for elected officials and government agency practitioners.

Their mission is to build knowledge and track improvements made within the field of online deliberation. The ODDC has created a number of online features, which include:\n</p><p>-Deliberative-democracy.net: the Internet\u2019s number one destination for news about deliberative democracy. It receives 3,000-4,000 hits each month and is the second site to appear when the words \u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d are searched on Google.\n</p><p>-The d-d.net eBulletin: a monthly electronic newsletter that highlights recent activity in the field, distributed via email to more than 700 subscribers.\n</p><p>-The Democracy Movement: a group blog maintained by more than a dozen leading scholars and practitioners in the field, that raises topics of interest related to democratic deliberation for discussion.\n</p><p>-The FedNet wiki: provides a private network for federal government managers to develop a community of practice through online knowledge sharing and networking.\n</p><p>-The Deliberative Democracy Handbook Online: a section of the d-d.net website dedicated entirely to the Handbook, providing chapter summaries, author bios, and discussion boards.\n</p><p>Much of the DDC\u2019s online activities are done through the Online Deliberative Democracy Workgroup (ODDW). This network of online deliberation leaders meet monthly to talk about their recent activities and to come up with strategies to encourage online deliberation efforts around the world. In June 2005, the ODDW held a regional meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, called \u201cDeepening Online Deliberation Through Practice and Research.\u201d The meeting was attended by state and local elected officials whom regarded it as highly productive. \u2028\n</p>\n<a name=\"Democratic_Governance\" id=\"Democratic_Governance\"></a><h3>Democratic Governance</h3>\n<p>Develops tools for leaders who are using deliberative strategies in their work.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects\" id=\"Major_Projects\"></a><h2>Major Projects</h2>\n<p>The DDC partners have given assistance to hundreds of public involvement projects that have engaged hundreds of thousands of people in dialogue, deliberation, and problem-solving.

Observatory on Participatory Democracy</a> (IOPD) is a space open to all cities in the world and all associations, organizations and research centres interested in learning about, exchanging impressions and applying experiences of participatory democracy on a local scale with the aim of deepening the roots of democracy in municipal government.</p><p>The network was created in 2001 within the framework of the European Commission\u2019s URB-AL programme for decentralized cooperation. It was officially constituted in November 2001 during the 1st Annual Conference of the IOPD in Barcelona, where their internal operating regulations were approved. Since 2006 the IOPD has coordinated with United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), mainly on the design of a joint framework of collaboration with the Committee on Social Inclusion and Participatory Democracy (CSIPD). <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>The IOPD\u2019s main activities include the following: Every year since it was created, the IOPD organises an international conference to advance discussions on participatory democracy and enable those attending to share experience and information in this field. It also awards its IOPD Distinction for Good Practice in Citizen Participation, in recognition of innovative experiences in participatory democracy that favour citizen participation and involvement in the preparation and implementation of public policies.</p><p>The IOPD website offers interested parties the possibility of visiting a database of experiences contributed by members, consulting studies, papers and other documents, news, links, calendar of events, etc., as well as accessing the IOPD\u2019s own publications and the media library.\u00a0</p><p>The definition of the IOPD work groups has taken shape within the framework of the annual conference. Reflection focuses on ways of promoting tools that strengthen democracy and give added impetus to the active participation of citizens in debates, designs, decisions and the implementation of public policies. All interested IOPD members may participate in the work groups and contribute to them. Each group is coordinated by a city, which, with the support of the Technical Secretariat, is responsible for issuing framework documents on work to be carried out, collecting contributions from members and making the work group as dynamic as possible. One of the results of these work groups is the Local Observatories on Participatory Democracy project, which was originally included within the framework of the European Commission\u2019s URB-AL programme for decentralized cooperation. Its main goal is to create local observatories in a number of European and Latin American cities to identify, evaluate and orient the development of different forms of participatory democracy and thereby to help direct the course of experiences that are under way. <a id=\"External_Links\" name=\"External_Links\"></a></p><h2>External Links</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.oidp.net/en/home/\">International Observatory on Participatory Democracy</a></p>", "geo_city": "Barcelona", "tags": null, "geo_province": "Barcelona", "title_en": "International Observatory on Participatory Democracy", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/international-observatory-participatory-democracy", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "53", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"LOGO2-OIDP2.png\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2011-12-14T00:59:09", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Lorenzo Marsili and Niccolo Milanese", "post_date": "2010-05-17T13:29:30", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "229", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Europe wide", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p><a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a></p><h2>Mission and Purpose</h2><p>European Alternatives is a civil society organisation devoted to exploring the potential for transnational politics and culture.

By cooperating and working in concert with one another, the goal of the organization is to bring about increased participation in local governments and growth of democracy.</p><p>With social justice being one of its main priorities, LogoLink operates to develop hands-on methods in hopes of engaging the public in social and political activities. A primary issue the organization is concerned with is the level of transparency and inclusiveness that exist within local government structures. LogoLink views communication between a government and its citizens as the foundation of a successful democracy. Because of this, the organization is dedicated to promoting transparency among government bodies and increasing the level of interaction they have with their constituents.</p><p>Some key objectives of the LogoLink network include:</p><p>\u2022 Construct areas where learning, sharing, and innovation can occur between members</p><p>\u2022 Devote major attention to practical and relatable expressions of democracy</p><p>\u2022 Cultivate relationships between governments and their citizens that are more reciprocal and balanced <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Most LogoLink participants are civil servants from various regions who have networked with one another in order to achieve common goals. Since social justice is founded in democratic practices, this network seeks to strengthen democratic systems and customs. The 2007 transfer of LogoLink\u2019s central directive institute\u2014Institute of Development Studies\u2014from the University of Sussex to The Polis Institute in the South reflects the unwavering commitment of the organization to the improvement of less developed areas of the world <a href=\"#cite_note-History-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a>. LogoLink has great faith in the South\u2019s capabilities with respect to planning and directing the affairs of global networks. LogoLink formed an Executive Committee to serve as a resource for governments. The Committee works together with the Internal Advisory Council, part of The Polis Institute, in order to provide optimal support for LogoLink partners. <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>Through a variety of projects, workshops, and research initiatives LogoLink is involved in the creation of practical expressions of democracy to be adopted by communities and their governments.</p><p>PROJECTS:</p><p>\u2022 Systematization &amp; Knowledge Dissemination<br />As LogoLink\u2019s current project, it involves the formation of a system by which to organize and present its purpose, progress in its first 10 years, and goals <a href=\"#cite_note-Projects:_Dissemination-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a>. This process is comprised of two main steps, the first being documentation and the second is systematization. Basically, the organization is creating a broad and general bank of principles, guidelines, and information which it hopes participants to adopt those portions that are relevant to their particular conditions.</p><p>\u2022 Participatory Planning<br />This project occurred in the earliest phases of LogoLink\u2019s existence, spanning over 2001 and part of 2002. It involved extensive research mainly in an effort to recreate lessons observed during fieldwork relating to participatory planning. This research period led to an international workshop during which case studies were discussed and examined. Workshop participants included 34 civil society organizations, local governments, and research institutions from 18 different nations around the world <a href=\"#cite_note-Projects:_Planning-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. The workshop gave each of the groups a chance to share their perspectives and exchange ideas about the lessons presented by LogoLink.</p><p>\u2022 ReCite (Resources, Citizen Engagements and Democratic Local Governance)<br />This project was LogoLink\u2019s third major endeavor. At the beginning of 2004 the organization began a large-scale research mission <a href=\"#cite_note-Projects:_ReCite-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a>. The ultimate goal of the project was to come up with ways for citizens to more consistently engage in local governance. The organization discovered that numerous obstacles restrict citizens\u2019 opportunities to participate in political activities in their area. As a result, LogoLink sought to create spaces and situations in which people would be able to engage in political processes and campaigns.</p><p>\u2022 Democratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality<br />This 2008 project was the product of earlier work done by the organization <a href=\"#cite_note-Projects:_Inequality-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a>. The key focuses of this phase of research were inequality and poverty in various environments around the world. LogoLink worked to improve the level of inclusiveness within systems in order to decrease the presence of inequality between citizens and their leaders.</p><p>\u2022 Legal Frameworks for Citizen Participation<br />This project spanned across 15 countries and occurred as a result of the work done by numerous individuals across these areas in 2003 <a href=\"#cite_note-Phase_II:_Legal-5\" title=\"\">[6]</a>. The main concern driving this project were the legal frameworks present within different areas and even more importantly, the citizens\u2019 knowledge of these frameworks and their relation to them. The objective of this project was to adapt previously-successful models to different regional contexts.</p><p>WORKSHOPS<br />(All info from here on must be cited, there was no way to not give the exact facts)</p><p>\u2022 LogoLink regional partners meeting \u2013 2005\u00a0<br />Cape Town, South Africa\u00a0<br />Participants: partners from Central America, the Andean region, South America, South and Southeast Asia, Eastern and Southern Africa, and the North</p><p>\u2022 East Africa Regional Conference on Citizen Engagement in Local Governance<br />Mukono district, Uganda<br />Participants: 27 representatives from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

In April 2003, after a great deal of collaborative research stemming from LogoLink\u2019s PHASE II project, the organization released a publication, \u201cLegal Frameworks for Citizen Participation: a synthesis report.\u201d The main aims of the project was: to conduct a comprehensive, comparative survey of legal and policy frameworks for citizen participation in local governance that operate in countries or states of federal republics in four regions (East Africa, Latin America, South Asia, South-East Asia); to synthesize existing knowledge about how these frameworks work in practice; and to draw lessons about the effectiveness of particular kinds of legal and policy framework for promoting citizen participation, including the importance of context in making models work or limiting their effectiveness, and the scope for transferring models into different country or regional contexts. <a href=\"#cite_note-Phase_II:_Legal-5\" title=\"\">[6]</a></p><p>In 2004, through the PHASE III project, \u201cReCite,\u201d LogoLink effectively contributed to the knowledge of participation in local governance and through research, campaigns, and learning lessons, helped strengthen the capacities of LogoLink partners.</p><p>LogoLink\u2019s PHASE IV project, \u201cDemocratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality,\u201d had LogoLink\u2019s partners engaging in a new research project. The research aimed to deepen knowledge on local democratic governance environments by pointing out other processes, factors and the central role of social and political actors, providing analysts, government decision-makers, citizen representatives and international development agencies with a critical assessment of existing experiences. <a href=\"#cite_note-Phase_IV:_Inequality-6\" title=\"\">[7]</a> All of the projects LogoLink has been working on have helped spread the ideals of a deliberative democratic system. <a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-History-0\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-History_0-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/about-us/what-is-logolink\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/about-us/what-is-logolink\">LogoLink - About Us (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)</a></li><li id=\"_Dissemination-1\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-Projects:_Dissemination_1-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/systematization-and-knowledge-dissemination\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/systematization-and-knowledge-dissemination\">Systematization &amp; Knowledge Dissemination (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)</a></li><li id=\"_Planning-2\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-Projects:_Planning_2-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/participatory-planning\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/participatory-planning\">Participatory Planning (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)</a></li><li id=\"_ReCite-3\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-Projects:_ReCite_3-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/recite\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/recite\">ReCite (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)</a></li><li id=\"_Inequality-4\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-Projects:_Inequality_4-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/legal-frameworks-for-citizen-participation\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/legal-frameworks-for-citizen-participation\">Democratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)</a></li><li id=\"_Legal-5\">\u2191 <a href=\"#cite_ref-Phase_II:_Legal_5-0\" title=\"\">6.0</a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Phase_II:_Legal_5-1\" title=\"\">6.1</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/legal-frameworks-for-citizen-participation\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/legal-frameworks-for-citizen-participation\">Legal Frameworks For Citizen Participation (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)</a></li><li id=\"_Inequality-6\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-Phase_IV:_Inequality_6-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/democratic-local-governance-fighting-inequality\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.logolink.org/index.php/projects-and-initiatives/projects/democratic-local-governance-fighting-inequality\">Democratic Local Governance Fighting Inequality (Accessed Dec, 4 2010)</a></li></ol><p><a id=\"Secondary_Sources\" name=\"Secondary_Sources\"></a></p><h2>Secondary Sources</h2><p>Suale Jr., Nelson, Alejandra M.

The initial mission was to promote the values and best practices associated with involving the public in government and industry decisions which affect their lives. The founding members assembled a Board of Directors, developed by-laws and policies, and organized the first annual conference in Portland, Oregon, in 1992. Practitioners, both professional and volunteer, were identified as the primary constituents for membership; a newsletter and an annual conference were selected as initial IAP2 activities.</p><p>IAP2 quickly grew and developed into an organization which looks beyond the formal practitioner to include all people involved in public participation. IAP2 added a semi-annual journal, web site, and local chapters to its list of services. In 1996, IAP2 changed its name to reflect this growing diversity and inclusiveness of membership. The organization has grown from 300 members in 1992 to over 1,050 in 2007, with members from 26 countries. Conferences have been held every year since 1992, alternating between U.S. and Canadian locales.</p><p>In the past few years, IAP2 has continued its growth and established itself as a leader in the field. In 1999, IAP2 launched its Certificate Training Course in Public Participation providing comprehensive training in the tools and skills needed for effective participation.

The Public Conversations Project is a non-profit organization whose mission is to train and promote everyone from single individuals to other organizations in being able to beneficially discuss issues that are important to them and the world. The Public Conversations Project\u2019s (PCP) goal is to bring together people of very opposing values in one room and allow them to communicate and understand where each person is coming from in order to create human relationships and understandings with even those who might have opinions and ideas from the opposite spectrum. PCP hopes to make people realize that those that might have been considered adversaries prior to their trained dialogues, can now work with each other toward a shared goal. PCP has worked with people from all sides of the world in order to truly bond everything from universities, other non-profit organizations, community groups, government agencies, faith communities, issue advocates, professionals in mediation and dispute resolution and private citizens. They believe that it\u2019s possible to bring any two people together and create a conversation of substance that will allow individuals to understand that together they can reach an area of common ground. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>A woman named Laura Chasin created this idea in 1989. It was after witnessing a debate on abortion on television that Chasin began to question how family therapy practices could improve very opposing conversations about abortion or other intense public issues. Although PCP was founded in 1989 it really didn\u2019t enter the publics eye until a horrible shooting in 1994 where a man named John Salvi walked into the Planned Parenthood clinic in Brookline and opened fire with a rifle, causing him to seriously wound three people and kill the receptionist. He then got in his car and drove two miles down Beacon Street to Preterm health Services where he injured two more people and killed another receptionist. This incident really caused the already enormous gap between those that were prolife and those that were prochoice to grow even larger, but it was because of this incident that three people who are prominent figures from both sides decided it was necessary to sit down and have a civilized conversation in order to prevent incidents like this from occurring again. These six people went to PCP and met in private using the organizations method of communicating. They learned about each other as people, started to care for one another, and realized that each person\u2019s vocabulary is what affects each other. Carefully learning these things through PCP\u2019s methods, they were able to mend the gap in a way where they could be civil to one another and respect one another\u2019s ideas and concerns. The article Talking with the Enemy, published in The Boston Globe, showed the public what had been happening in secrecy and really brought people\u2019s attention to PCP as an organization that created constructive dialogues about all different conflicts. It was the beginning of PCP for something great. <a id=\"Specializations_and_activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and activities</h2><p>The idea that PCP had was one that has been thought about and created many times before, it was the methods of accomplishing these constructive dialogues that allowed PCP to be seen as different and successful. The way PCP staff facilitates and teaches people how to communicate with one another has roots in family systems therapy methods and goals. The goal with using family therapist skills is to prevent people from seeing each other as enemies but to see each other through personal experiences and deeper understandings. There goal is not to change people\u2019s minds or make the group come out with one answer to the problem, but more so to have people come out with respect for the other side and understanding of where each person is coming from. They hope to make connections between people that before would have assumed there was no way to relate to someone with such an opposing view. They, like many other organizations, wish to promote public deliberation where they encourage participation in democracy through there methods of constructive conversations. Although public deliberation typically is more based around decision-making, PCP does not intend for the group to come out with a decision, but to instead come out more enlightened.</p><p>PCP has three methods in order to provide productive dialogue. First, it takes preventative measures in order to guarantee that the conversation won\u2019t turn into a debate. All those that intend to participate in the conversation are contacted before and are asked to listen to some ground rules, such as not talking over one another and waiting till the facilitator has asked you a question. This will ensure that no one in the group gets attacked, or feels as though they must put their guard up and not truly say how they feel. Secondly, PCP has a variety of facilitative processes such as keeping the conversation on track, asking the questions, setting the tone of the interactions and conversation and enforcing the ground rules. Lastly, PCP works with the participants in creating the overall process such as the ground rules. They allow the participants to work together to realize what rules should be instated in order to not offend themselves and to see what things they do that offends others. This is the beginning of showing the group what things affect what people and making everyone more conscious of even the little things. The point of these three steps is to get the participants to realize that in no shape or form are they there to try to change people\u2019s mind or to prove that they\u2019re right. The point is for everyone to share experiences and talk about who they are in order to really show each other what it\u2019s like in their shoes.</p><p>With all of these methods and ideas, PCP has really made headway in the world as a program that has had the ability to bring polar opposite sides together and on the same page. It is for this reason that they have been asked to work with all different types of groups from universities to community groups. PCP serves so many different groups from all different backgrounds in order to get one thing out of it for them, which is a chance to really communicate. Since PCP has become seen as an organization with a lot of power to bring people together they have been working on projects to expand not just in America but also around the world. One of PCP\u2019s most recent projects includes uniting fiver Israeli and five Palestinian journalists and have them communicate and discuss the challenges both sides face and figure out ways to manage reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The hope was that through the dialogue workshop, the participants would gain better understanding of each other\u2019s experiences and constraints. This is showing that PCP is not only trying to bring deliberative discussions in America but they wish to have people all around the world have the ability to sit down and come together. Aside from worldly issues, PCP has worked with issues such as health care, higher education and public policy like abortion. They believe it is very possible to take the most scared to talk about issues, and put two of the most opposing people together, and bring them to respect one another. <a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>Having PCP become a non-profit organization means that they are always interested in foundations funding and supporting their vision. PCP has been fortunate enough to have many different foundations fund their organization in order to continue bringing people together. Some foundations that have been interested in their work include The Boston Foundation, United States Institute of Peace, Rockefeller Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation and many more. PCP was initially founded as a project of Family Institute of Cambridge. It wasn\u2019t till 1996 when they received an initial grant from William and Flora Hewlett Foundation that PCP became a nonprofit organization. Aside from receiving funding from foundations, PCP also accepts donations from individuals or other organizations that feel that what PCP has done is useful and right for not only the country but also the world. They appreciate any donation in order to allow the process of deliberation to continue to occur. <a id=\"Publications\" name=\"Publications\"></a></p><h2>Publications</h2><p>PCP has had the privilege to be mentioned in the news all around the country in order to make people aware of what is going on and what PCP has to offer. Some of the most famous publication of PCP in the news includes an article from Newsday where a PCP Associate named Mary Jacksteit answered questions about how she would be able to help resolve the conflicts over abortion and health care reform. Answering these kinds of questions in the news allows the public to see the methods that PCP uses and the successes PCP has the ability to have. Furthermore, PCP has been mentioned in articles discussing how two very opposite sides have had the ability to talk and communicate with one another and how these polarized sides have come to PCP with the hope that they can someday understand one another and reach some form of common ground.</p><p>When the National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation asked on their website, thataway.org, which programs have addressed the partisan divide in the U.S. through dialogue, deliberation and conflict resolution, PCP was mentioned and recommended for this very cause. The PCP organization has grown to become a place where people of all different voices and opinions can be heard and appreciated for who they are. The organization continues to show people that just because a person may think one way they have the ability to listen to the other side comfortably, professionally and honorably without creating hatred and fear. As time goes by it is more and more evident that if PCP will continue to create a change. <a id=\"Seconday_Sources\" name=\"Seconday_Sources\"></a></p><h2>Seconday Sources</h2><p>\"Talking with the Enemy.\" The Boston Globe.

We do work on in-depth and fair deliberations, both in-person and online, in order to build meaningful new ways for the public to weigh in on the important issues facing us all.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Healthy Democracy grew out of the successful work of our sister organization, Healthy Democracy Oregon, to promote an innovative reform of the ballot initiative process. This reform, called the\u00a0<a href=\"http://healthydemocracy.org/citizens-initiative-review/\">Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review</a>\u00a0(CIR),\u00a0presents voters with clear, useful, and trustworthy evaluations of statewide ballot measures. Since 2009, Healthy Democracy has led efforts to develop and refine the Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review process for use by Oregon voters.</p><p>In 2011, the Oregon Legislature approved House Bill 2634, legislation making the Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review a permanent part of Oregon elections. This marked the first time a legislature has made voter deliberation a formalized part of the election process. The CIR is a benchmark in the initiative reform and public engagement fields.</p><p>Healthy Democracy was selected by the newly formed Oregon Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review Commission to run two Reviews during the 2012 election cycle \u2014 the first official state CIRs.\u00a0</p><h2>Citizens' Initiative Review</h2><p>The Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review is a proven way of publicly evaluating ballot measures so that voters have clear, useful, and trustworthy information at election time.</p><p>During the Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review, a panel of randomly-selected and demographically-balanced voters is brought together from across the state to fairly evaluate a ballot measure. The panel hears directly from advocates\u00a0for and against the measure and calls upon policy experts during the multi-day public review.</p><p>For each measure reviewed, a new panel is convened. At the conclusion of each review, panelists draft a \u2018Citizens\u2019 Statement\u2019 highlighting the most important findings about the measure. Each \u2018Citizens\u2019 Statement\u2019 is published as a prominent page in the voters\u2019 pamphlet as a new and easily accessible resource for voters to use at election time.</p><p>The CIR was adopted into Oregon Law during the 2011 session of the Oregon Legislature. Healthy Democracy worked on behalf of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review Commission to run two CIRs for the 2012 election cycle and plans to run two more in 2014.</p><h2>Citizens' Initiative Review Commission</h2><p>In June, 2011, the Oregon legislature approved House Bill 2634, legislation making the Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review a permanent part of Oregon elections.

Since the organization was founded, the Center has assisted with over 120 initiatives that seek to provide the everyday citizen with a voice in how their news is covered. By doing this, the public is encouraged to share what they believe are problems, and then deliberate on solutions - making them more active citizens. \n</p><p>The Center supported projects concerning public engagement, quality of life, elections, race relations, crime, economy, youth/children, education, citizenship and governance. \n</p><p>One of their projects that received a significant amount of media attention as well as a notable increase in civil engagement is one called The Citizens Election Project.

This book served as the stepping point for public engagement and interaction with the OPE and federal government.   In January 2009, Americans contributed to the publication of the Citizen\u2019s Briefing Handbook by sharing their concerns, ideas, and potential solutions to current issues.  The topics that were addressed in it dealt with: the US economy; education; energy and the environment; foreign policies; health care; homeland security; services; technology; and veterans.\n</p><p>The main requests that were mentioned in the handbook in regards to the topic of the US economy involved changes in taxation and employment.  Americans wanted lower taxes, trade schools, and more jobs.  In terms of education, US citizens strongly supported a change in sex education.  Instead of abstinence-based education, they wanted sex education to be more \u201cage appropriate.\u201d Citizens also wanted students to gain more knowledge on eating healthier and the nutritional value of various foods.  Additionally, they also wanted more attention drawn toward the arts, libraries, and science/engineering.   \n</p><p>When it came to the energy and environment in the United States, citizens wanted their country to be more \u201cgreen.\u201d  They were also supportive of additional public transportation systems, such as bullet rains and light rails.  For foreign policy, they strongly encouraged the elimination of Torture facilities.  Other issues regarding foreign policy concerned the aid to Israel, Cuba, the WHINSEC, and peace between Palestine and Israel.  Under health care, the main issues addressed were: marijuana laws; health insurance companies; honoring terminally ill patients\u2019 decision to pass.  They also brought up the right each person has to having a healthy body, and funding for childhood care cancer.\n</p><p>In regards to homeland security, Americans argued against wars on abstract concepts and \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d They also requested a legislation that would protect \u201cwhistle blowers,\u201d a new decentralized energy grid, and an equal balance between US Security and Civil Liberties.  Under service, they mentioned expanding Americorps, the idea of an e-library, expanding small business programs, and national service for college students.  \n</p><p>The suggestions and input the US citizens had for technology were: legalizing online poker; restoring net neutrality protections; vote and deliberate on all bills on the Internet; create a suggestions/idea website for each state governor; and offer national WiFi.  In regards to United States veterans, the main request was to entitle soldiers to their signing bonuses, regardless of whether they received an injury.  Americans also mentioned their disapproval toward tour extensions, wanting to receive detailed explanations of their medical benefits upon their departure from the military, VA benefits, and VA Hospital Reform.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Activities\" id=\"Activities\"></a><h2>Activities</h2>\n<p>The activities and events the OPE offer for the American public to participate in are:\n</p><p>-Teleconferences\n</p><p>-Collaboration Sessions\n</p><p>-Listening Sessions\n</p><p>-Information Sharing Sessions\n</p><p>-Webinars\n</p><p>-Stakeholder meetings\n</p><p>-Town Hall meetings\n</p><p>-Other special events\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>The OPE is funded by the <a href=\"http://www.usa.gov/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.usa.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United States federal government</a>\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects\" id=\"Major_Projects\"></a><h2>Major Projects</h2>\n<p>Some of the major issues and projects the OPE have been working on are posted on their <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope/blog\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog</a>.  Lately, the topics the OPE have been focusing on have mainly involved employment, health care, and taxation.  On March of 2010, the White House hosted a listening session for representatives from numerous non-profit, private, and public groups.  They discussed financial and educational capability, and how many citizens today have limited resources that prevent them from obtaining a financially secure future.  The White House and sectors heard directly from citizens that are experiencing this problem firsthand, and are currently working with the Financially Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC), Department of Treasury, and Department of Education to handle the issue.  Recently, the Treasury and Department of Education issued an awards program that is aimed to further educate high school students on finances and their capabilities. \n</p><p>In addition to assisting citizens with limited resources, President Obama also has been responding to the public\u2019s request for improved health care.  On March 2010, after numerous OPE events, his <a href=\"http://www.healthreform.gov/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.healthreform.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Health Reform</a> got approved, and he passed the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/health_reform_for_women.pdf\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/health_reform_for_women.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Affordable Care Act</a>.  The Health Reform guarantees health care for each American.  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) entitles women and their children to affordable health treatment and coverage.  They will have lower medical costs, insurance security, and good quality treatment.  Insurance companies can no longer deny them coverage due to pre-existing health conditions, and women have more health insurance companies to select from while choosing a provider.\n</p><p>One of the many ways the OPE partake on the issue of taxes and the US economy is to plan meetings between the federal government and various organizations.  These types of events typically involve the federal government informing organization leaders of recently approved bills, laws, measures, tax cuts, etc.  For instance, in April 2010, the OPE held a meeting for under-represented organizations at the White House.  They discussed a recently passed bill that will fund summer jobs, and a new measure that has provided tax cuts for companies that hire unemployed citizens.\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Secondary_Lit\" id=\"Secondary_Lit\"></a><h2>Secondary Lit</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_docid=129DBAB23B0D7268&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=%28%20129DBAB23B0D7268%20%29&amp;p_multi=MVNN&amp;s_lang=en-US&amp;p_nbid=W4FL52NLMTI3NTU5MjQ0OS4zMTUxOTI6MTo3Om5jZDgyMzY\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://iw.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_docid=129DBAB23B0D7268&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=%28%20129DBAB23B0D7268%20%29&amp;p_multi=MVNN&amp;s_lang=en-US&amp;p_nbid=W4FL52NLMTI3NTU5MjQ0OS4zMTUxOTI6MTo3Om5jZDgyMzY\" rel=\"nofollow\">Newsbank: Office of Public Engagement set --new name, mission for White House liaison - Citizens'Briefing Book has ideas from Americans across the country </a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=ea015fc544007210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ea015fc544007210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=ea015fc544007210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ea015fc544007210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD\" rel=\"nofollow\">US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://whitehousetransitionproject.org/resources/briefing/WHTP-2009-03-Public%20Liaison.pdf\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://whitehousetransitionproject.org/resources/briefing/WHTP-2009-03-Public%20Liaison.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"White House Office of Public Liaison\"</a>\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Links\" id=\"Links\"></a><h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope\" rel=\"nofollow\">Office of Public Engagement (OPE)</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Launches-Office-of-Public-Engagement/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Launches-Office-of-Public-Engagement/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OPE Statement from White House</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/Citizens_Briefing_Book_Final2.pdf\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/Citizens_Briefing_Book_Final2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Citizen's Briefing Handbook</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.usa.gov/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.usa.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United States</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope/blog\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">OPE Blog</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.healthreform.gov/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.healthreform.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heath Reform Website</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/health_reform_for_women.pdf\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/health_reform_for_women.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Affordable Care Act</a>\n</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Office of Public Engagement", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/office-public-engagement", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "38\u00b0 53' 51.5256\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "109", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "77\u00b0 2' 11.6232\" W", "fulltime_staff": "20", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Government", "updated_date": "2011-12-21T22:14:32", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Judith A.

Racial reconciliation, through assembling and encouraging dialogue throughout the nation, was to serve as representative of reconciling racial and ethnic divisions wherever they existed in our country. Through strengthening our infrastructure, Americans could Clinton pledged to lead \"the American people in a great and unprecedented conversation on race.\" <a href=\"#cite_note-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>The purpose of this 15-month initiative was to encourage our nation to participate in endeavors to progress beyond the racial disparities of our present and past. Through contemplative examination, valuable dialogue, and affirmative moves, the initiative attempted to help America heal racial and ethnic divisions. The first, would be to encourage communities across the country to become involved in a \u201cNational Conversation on Race.\u201d This would explore the history of our country\u2019s race relations. The second facet of the initiative would attempt to alleviate the opportunity gap that exists among the disparities of Americans regarding employment, education, health care, home ownership, and the administration of justice, where race is a indicator. <a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p><p>The stated purpose of the race initiative was to:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHelp educate Americans about the facts surrounding issues of race, to promote a dialogue in every community of die land and to confront and work through these issues, to recruit and encourage leadership at all levels to help breach racial divides, and to find, develop, and recommend how to implement concrete solutions to our problems\u2014 solutions that will involve all of us in government, business, communities, and as individual citizens.\u201c <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a> <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p></blockquote><h2>History</h2><p>The first attempt in nearly thirty years by a United States\u2019 President, this Initiative ventured to seriously and methodically approach and solve the ongoing matter of \u201crace\u201d in our country. <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a></p><p>President Clinton developed a seven-member Advisory Board, which served to encourage community dialogue and were obliged to report to him regarding issues surrounding their mission of reconciling racial tension. They were expected to reach out to the diverse groups of our communities in our nation and take heed of the viewpoints of Americans from every background. In turn, ideally we would increasingly acknowledge the reasons and origins of racial tension in our nation.</p><p>The Board was expected to provide their supposed diverse viewpoints to the President. The precise objectives of the Board, specified in the Executive Order, were to:</p><p>1. Promote a constructive national dialogue to confront and work through challenging issues that surround race;</p><p>2. Increase the Nation\u2019s understanding of our recent history of race relations;</p><p>3. Bridge racial divides by encouraging leaders . . . to develop and implement innovative approaches to calming racial tensions;</p><p>4. Identify, develop, and implement solutions to problems in areas in which race has a substantial impact.. .\u2019 <a href=\"#cite_note-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a></p><p>The Advisory Board was expected to examine fundamental scopes in which imbalance and inconsistencies regarding race were present and of importance. These areas were issues such as education, economic opportunity, housing, health care, and the administration of justice. It was viewed by some, that the long and deep-rooted feelings of minorities of the country, such as Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, African Americans and white ethnics, were difficult to be understood, and beyond the realm of a small and poorly funded governmental Advisory Board. The White House also failed to incorporate a Native American member of the Advisory Board, which proved to be a shortcoming of this race initiative. <a href=\"#cite_note-5\" title=\"\">[6]</a></p><p>The initiative was criticized heavily during its short-lived 15-month existence. This is because it was viewed that President Clinton\u2019s program had no particular end goal in sight. \u201cTalking about race\u201d proved to be difficult because America is heavily divided not only by race but based on differences of multicultural and multiethnic qualities. How is every single person to be labeled and represented by a 7-member advisory board? The most dominant denunciation of the Initiative was its focus on dialogue amongst the population. Critics of the initiative dismissed the idea that mere dialogue would resolve the nation\u2019s racial disparities and issues. However, President Clinton\u2019s point was not expectant on dialogue to solve problems, but rather be the initial necessity to precede positive movement. <a href=\"#cite_note-6\" title=\"\">[7]</a></p><p>In a 1995 statement, President Clinton declared that \"I am convinced, based on a rich lifetime of friendships and common endeavors with people of different races, that the American people will find out they have a lot more in common than they think they do.\"</p><p>In his first town hall meeting in Akron, Ohio wherein he vindicated the grounds for his race initiative, he reemphasized that notion by saying, \u201cWhat what we're trying to do here is drop a pebble in the pond and have it reverberate all across America, because I honestly believe that this is a good country full of good people.\" In another event, Clinton stated that \"We should not underestimate the power of dialogue and conversation to melt away misunderstanding and to change the human heart.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-7\" title=\"\">[8]</a></p><p>President Clinton\u2019s confidence in dialogue divulged a notion that racist divides were rooted in ignorance, and that interaction and dialogue would pave the way to understanding.</p><p>When President Clinton initially publicized the initiative in 1997, he intended to execute its focus during his second term of presidency. However, most of Clinton\u2019s second term was interfered by media focus on scandals, and him compelled to defend himself and his presidency. Needless to say, the race initiative became less of a priority and received limited news coverage and attention. <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>In the course of the race initiative, President Clinton took part in three publicized \u201ctown hall\u201d conferences on race. Clinton made observations and remarks at the Advisory Board meetings and also conduced an \u201cOutreach Meeting\u201d at the White House with an assembly of conservative critics. Clinton pronounced various speeches on race as well.</p><p>The President\u2019s Initiative on Race assembled information regarding programs and efforts that helped to accomplish President Clinton\u2019s vision of One America in the 21st century. These programs were called \u201cPromising Practices for Racial Reconciliation\u201d and epitomized the endeavors of Americans who realized that racial disparities are not easily conquered without needed attention. The programs ranged from categories such as Arts, Multi-Media, and Sports, Business, Community and Economic Development, Community Building, Education, Government, Health and Human Services, and Youth. These programs were listed in \u201cTo One America in the 21st Century: Promising Practices for Racial Conciliation\u201d While they each differentiated from one another in particular focus, they all contributed to effort of racial reconciliation. <a id=\"Major_Projects_.26_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_.26_Events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects &amp; Events</h2><p>Using the conclusions from the Advisory Board\u2019s discussions, analysis, and movement of the initiative, President Clinton presented a report to the American people. This report, called \u201cOne America in the 21st Century: Forging a New Future\u201d was a framework for the progress of race relations in our country. <a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-0\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Carcasson, Martin &amp; Mitchell Rice. \u201cThe Promise and Failure of President Clinton\u2019s Race Initiative of 1997-1998: A Rhetorical Perspective.\u201d Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 2:2 (1999): 243-274.</li><li id=\"cite_note-1\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Goering, John. \u201cAn Assessment of President Clinton\u2019s Initiative on Race\u2019, Ethnic and Racial Studies.\u201d Ethnic and Racial Studies 24:3 (2001): 472-484.</li><li id=\"cite_note-2\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Carcasson, Martin &amp; Mitchell Rice. \u201cThe Promise and Failure of President Clinton\u2019s Race Initiative of 1997-1998: A Rhetorical Perspective.\u201d Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 2:2 (1999): 243-274.</li><li id=\"cite_note-3\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Goering, John. \u201cAn Assessment of President Clinton\u2019s Initiative on Race\u2019, Ethnic and Racial Studies.\u201d Ethnic and Racial Studies 24:3 (2001): 472-484.</li><li id=\"cite_note-4\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Goering, John. \u201cAn Assessment of President Clinton\u2019s Initiative on Race\u2019, Ethnic and Racial Studies.\u201d Ethnic and Racial Studies 24:3 (2001): 472-484.</li><li id=\"cite_note-5\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Carcasson, Martin &amp; Mitchell Rice. \u201cThe Promise and Failure of President Clinton\u2019s Race Initiative of 1997-1998: A Rhetorical Perspective.\u201d Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 2:2 (1999): 243-274.</li><li id=\"cite_note-6\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Kim, Claire Jean. \u201cClinton\u2019s Race Initiative: Recasting the American Dilemma.\u201d Polity 33:2 (2000): 175-197.</li><li id=\"cite_note-7\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> Carcasson, Martin &amp; Mitchell Rice. \u201cThe Promise and Failure of President Clinton\u2019s Race Initiative of 1997-1998: A Rhetorical Perspective.\u201d Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 2:2 (1999): 243-274.</li></ol><p><a id=\"External_links\" name=\"External_links\"></a></p><h2>External links</h2><ul><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://clinton3.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/america.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://clinton3.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/america.html\">http://clinton3.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/america.html</a></li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.racematters.org/oneamericadialogueguide.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.racematters.org/oneamericadialogueguide.htm\">http://www.racematters.org/oneamericadialogueguide.htm</a></li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/Practices/ppreport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/Practices/ppreport.pdf\">http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/Practices/ppreport.pdf</a></li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/PIR_summary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/PIR_summary.pdf\">http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/PIR_summary.pdf</a></li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/excerpts/lawson_oneamerica.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/excerpts/lawson_oneamerica.pdf\">http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/excerpts/lawson_oneamerica.pdf</a></li></ul>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "President Clinton's Initiative on Race", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/president-clintons-initiative-race", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "103", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2011-12-13T22:50:26", "volunteer_count": "600", "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Andy Hamflett", "post_date": "2010-06-02T11:18:45", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "257", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "London", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": "1", "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Budgeting||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)||Environment||Health||Education &amp; Schools", "body_en": "<p>The UK Youth Parliament (UKYP) is a London-based organization that gives the United Kingdom's youth a voice in politics. \"Run by young people for young people\", UKYP consists of more than 600 democratically elected Members of Youth Parliament (MYPs), ranging from age 11 to 18.

The parliament serves to represent the views of diverse youth on government and services within the United Kingdom.  It has been praised by a wide array of politicians and leaders including Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown.  Brown has called the UK Youth Parliament \u201ca symbol of the politics we should all strive for \u2013politics that bring people together to work for what is best for us all.\u201d\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1996, youth at the event \u201cHeirs to the Millennium\u201d protested to Andrew Rowe (the organizer) that there was a lack of youth voice in government.  In response, Andrew along with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and youth worker, Kate Parish, began to create a proposal for the youth advocacy group.  By 1998, a steering group had been formed and included predominately youth members and co-chairs approved by Andrew.  \n</p><p>The UKYP launched in 1999 in the House of Commons and by 2000, Malcolm Wicks (Minister for Lifelong Learning in the Department of Education and Employment) decided to staff the project.  In February 2001 UKYP had its first sitting in the House of Commons in London.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Formation\" id=\"Formation\"></a><h2>Formation</h2>\n<p>Since the launch, this youth parliament has grown to over 600 elected Members of Youth Parliament (MYPs) and Deputy Members of Youth Parliament (DMYPs) which consist of men and women of diverse ethnic, social and economic backgrounds.\n</p><p>UK Youth Parliament elections occur every year and all youth ages 11 through 18 are eligible to vote in local elections.  In 2008 there were 1,625 young candidates and over 565,802 of the United Kingdom\u2019s youth voted in elections.  Currently 90% of England\u2019s education department called the Local Education Authorities holds the elections.  The number of elected members is proportionate to the population of the region.   \n</p><p>The administrative aspect of the parliament is overseen by the board of trustees which consists of half MYPs who are elected from their region every two years, and half stakeholders from various organizations including one representative of each major political party.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Events\" id=\"Events\"></a><h2>Events</h2>\n<p>The UKYP holds three annual events including their Annual Sitting, Circles of Influence and debate in the House of Commons.  In 2008 they also held a debate within the prestigious House of Lords.\n</p><p>The Annual Sitting is the largest UKYP event of the year and includes all the elected young members.  This deliberative event takes place over three days on a university campus and features speakers from the British Parliament.  At the Annual Sitting, the Members of Youth Parliament hold debates on seven areas: Culture, Media and Sport, Education and Employment, Empowering Young People, Health, International Matters, Law and Society, and Transport, Environment and Rural Affairs.  During each Annual Sitting the MYPs create a manifesto which adequately represents the issues important to youth and includes policies centered on the seven areas of debate.  Upon completion, the manifesto is passed on to the government to reflect current important issues of the United Kingdom\u2019s youth.\n</p><p>Circles of Influence incorporates government and private organizations in a conversation with UKYP members.  Two hundred members discuss important youth issues which in the past have included leadership and aptitude.\n</p><p>After much debate within the House of Commons chambers, the United Kingdom Youth Parliament was finally granted annual access to hold House of Commons in March 2010.  The topics to be debated are decided in an online vote prior to the event.  One of the issues discussed in 2009 was lowering the voting age to 16.  UKYP member, James Evans, exclaimed \u201cAt 16, we can marry\u2026have children\u2026sign up in preparation for fighting and potentially die and suddenly we are not mature enough to vote. What an absolute disgrace!\u201d  In addition to lowering the voting age, the parliament discussed eliminating college tuition fees, reducing youth crime, providing free transportation to the elderly, and how to provide more job opportunities for young people. \n</p><p>On May 2, 2008, the UKYP held a debate among 300 members in the House of Lords.

Shifting from its original principles, PASOK is now shifting the tax base, cutting salaries in both private and public sectors, and cutting social welfare. PASOK still defines their party as a social democracy. \n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>PASOK was created in response to the collapse of the military dictatorship in Greece in 1974. Its founder, Andreas Papandreou, founded PASOK on the ideals of National Independence, Popular Sovereignty, Social Emancipation, and Democratic Process. \n</p><p>PASOK\u2019s presence in Grecian government became prominent in its early years. By November 1977 elections, just three years after being established, PASOK had doubled its share of votes and won 92 seats, becoming the main opposition party. PASOK won 173 seats by 1981 and formed the first socialist government in Greece since 1924.  \n</p><p>From 1985 \u2013 1993 PASOK experienced extreme policy changes and financial and corruption scandals, which led to it\u2019s brief decline in governmental influence. By 1995 Papandreou led PASOK to a landslide victory and regained control of the Grecian government. \n</p><p>In 1996 Papandreou was forced to step down due to his ailing health and was succeeded by Costas Simitis. Simitis started the pro-European wing of PASOK, and was accredited to modernizing PASOK. Yet, his lack of opinion and action of the Imia crisis caused him to have a flawed image by the Grecian people. In a time of Athens hosting the Olympics and terrorist attacks, PASOK lost its traditional appeal to the Greek lower and middle classes, resulting in a loss of elections in 2004. The New Democracy party had taken over from 2004 until 2009 when PASOK, now led by George Papandreou, finally regained election.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Secondary_Sources\" id=\"Secondary_Sources\"></a><h2>Secondary Sources</h2>\n<ul><li>\"Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2010.

The Prudential Foundation sponsored the project.</p><p>Participants were allowed to take part in any of five online forums that spanned across all different issues. The first forum was on Social Security reform and served as an introduction for users to the website and lasted the entire duration of the time frame.</p><p>The second forum presented the question of why the system needs reformation now. It made participants question whether the system meet the needs currently or if it were in desperate need of change. This forum took place between April 26 and May 7, 1999.</p><p>The third online forum focused on the options available for reform of the Social Security system. It took place from May 3 \u2013 May 14, 1999.</p><p>The fourth forum presented the idea of having a Social Security Trust Fund that invested in the stock market and whether it would be a good idea to invest a portion of Social Security in the market to generate income.

But the opposition declines when they survey asks them to choose between increasing the full-benefit age and reducing benefit amounts. 54 percent chose to raise the age of eligibility instead of decreasing benefits.</p><p>Another survey showed that 63 percent were in favor of keeping a trust fund over investing in the stock market. 66 percent claim a safe investment is more important than a riskier investment with the potential to make more money.</p><p>After all the surveys, it is became apparent that Americans believed maintaining benefit levels and guaranteeing those benefits for everyone were the most important items. <a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p><a id=\"The_Pew_Charitable_Trusts\" name=\"The_Pew_Charitable_Trusts\"></a></p><h3>The Pew Charitable Trusts</h3><p>The ADSS is funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which is an independent non-profit and non-governmental organization founded in 1948 with the mission to serve the public interest.

A typical Jury consists of 24 members who meet for five to seven full days, though the number of jurors and the duration of the project varies depending on the issue in question.</p><p>Jefferson Center founder, Ned Crosby, first created the Citizen Jury method in the early 1970s. Since that time, the Jefferson Center has led or assisted in more than 30 Juries on public policy issues from climate change to property taxes to health care. A full history of the Jefferson Center can be found on the <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history\">Center's Website. </a>The Jefferson Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit; in 2005 a partner organization, <a href=\"http://www.jeffersonaction.org/\">Jefferson Action</a>, (formerly Promoting Healthy Democracy) was formed to promote and apply the Citizens Jury method in ways appropriate for a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, such as electoral contexts or lobbying for specific legislative changes.<a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h1>History</h1><p>\u00a0</p><p>Founded by political scientist Ned Crosby in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1974, the Jefferson Center (originally named Center for New Democratic Processes) held its first Citizens Jury in 1974 on health care. A 1976 Citizens Jury was the first used to evaluate candidates running for office. Five Juries in 1984 on Agricultural Impact on Water Quality were the first to feature official government sponsors.</p><p>By the late 1980s, the Center began experimenting with using the Citizens Jury method in a new form of political evaluation. Juries were held to examine major political candidates. In 1989, the Jefferson Center convened a Citizen Jury to examine candidates in the mayoral race in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1990, the Center ran a similar project examining the Governor\u2019s race in Minnesota. And in 1992 a variation on Citizen Jury method called the <a href=\"http://jeffersonaction.org/how-we-work/citizens-election-forums/\"><em>Citizen Election Forum</em></a> was held in cooperation with the League of Women Voters to examine candidates for U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania. The 1992 project received high praise in various Pennsylvania based publications. The method seemed to be gaining momentum and the League of Women Voters approached the Jefferson Center to offer juries about the race for governor in 1993.</p><p>In 1993, the Center decided to shift gears from specific candidate evaluation towards a more national deliberative style, focusing instead on budgets and the Clinton health care reform plan in 1993. The next projects included the first Jury run by college students, with a class at Yale University in 1994. A Jury on welfare reform was sponsored by a Minnesota-based member of the U.S. House of Representatives. A project conducted in Dakota County, Minnesota was named a semifinalist in the <em>Innovations in American Government</em> award program at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.</p><p>Although these Citizens Juries continued to earn praise from observers and high ratings from participants, the leadership of the organization became frustrated that the Juries\u2019 recommendations were not being heeded by policymakers. The Center closed in 2002, although founder Ned Crosby continued to experiment and carry out projects on an ad hoc basis. In 2005, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit partner organization, <a href=\"http://www.jeffersonaction.org\">Jefferson Action,</a> was incorporated.</p><p>By 2008 there was a renewed interest in the Citizens Jury method, sparked in part by a successful application of the method in Oregon. Inspired by work started by Crosby and his wife Pat Benn in Washington State (and with their support), a locally-created independent organization named <a href=\"http://healthydemocracy.org/\">Healthy Democracy Oregon (HDO)</a> developed a process called Citizens Initiative Reviews (CIR) that used the Citizens Jury method to evaluate statewide ballot initiatives. HDO secured state government approval of two pilot CIRs in 2010, and the results were published in the voters\u2019 guide mailed out by the Secretary of State before the election. In 2011 a bill permanently instituting the CIR process was approved by the Oregon state legislature and signed by the governor.</p><p>In 2009, in the aftermath of the close U.S. Senate race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman, the Jefferson Center and Jefferson Action held a <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/2000s/election-recounts-2009/\">Citizens Jury examining election recount processes in Minnesota.</a> The Jury was credited with helping build bi-partisan support for proposed state legislation that had failed only a few months earlier. The results were also presented at the National Association of Secretaries of State meeting in July 2009, where the participants responded to the jury\u2019s report with a standing ovation.</p><p>The Citizens Jury method has proven popular with participants, <a href=\"http://http:/jefferson-center.org/what-we-do/citizen-juries/bias-evaluation/\">who consistently give it positive feedback and rate the process as fair and free of bias by the organizers.</a> Outside observers \u2013 including local and national media -- have also generally praised the process. The method has been utilized by other organizations in Finland, Australia, Spain, Germany and elsewhere. The government in Great Britain has held more than 300 Citizens Juries, although these differ significantly from the method as the Jefferson Center implements it.</p><p><a id=\"Current_Projects\" name=\"Current_Projects\"></a></p><h1>Current Projects</h1><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Jefferson Center continues to explore opportunities where the Citizens Jury process may be utilized to allow citizen voices to influence public policy.\u00a0 The staff is available to assist public agencies looking for a method to learn the well-considered opinion of representatives of their constituency and they are also alert for opportunities to initiate, in collaboration with partners, worthy projects where a well-informed citizen perspective has the potential to support the development of sound public policy.</p><p><a id=\"Past_Projects\" name=\"Past_Projects\"></a></p><h1>Past Projects</h1><p>\u00a0</p><p>Most recently, the Jefferson center noticed the long-term demographic and economic trends pose tremendous challenges for the nation and a increasingly-polarized public makes it difficult for policymakers to effectively address these challenges. In May 2012 the Jefferson Center conducted two Citizen Juries asking jurors to choose a set of policy areas that are most important for the economy, and to identify areas of agreement within some of those policy questions. <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/how-we-work/current-projects/\">The process was carefully documented,</a> and a <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/2010s/economy-and-federal-debt-2012/\">final report of the jurors\u2019 can be found on the Center\u2019s website.</a> In the fall of 2012, the 501(c)(4) partner Jefferson Action conducted a Citizens Election Forum that covered much of the same policy ground and that added the examination of congressional candidates\u2019 stands. <a href=\"http://jeffersonaction.org/what-we-do/current-projects/\">That process received a large amount of local media coverage and participation from both major party candidates.</a></p><p>Additionally, <a href=\"http://www.jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history\">reports from the Jefferson Center\u2019s 30+ past projects are available on its website.</a> Around 1/3 of its Citizens Juries have been held outside its home state of Minnesota, and issues have included <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/2000s/early-childhood-education-2008/\">education</a>, <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/1990s/low-income-housing-1991/\">low-income housing</a>, <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/1990s/welfare-reform-1994/\">welfare reforms</a>, <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/2000s/375-2/\">climate change</a> and <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/1990s/physician-assisted-suicide-1998/\">physician-assisted suicide,</a> as well as locally-relevant issues such as <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/1990s/traffic-congestion-pricing-1995/\">traffic congestion</a> and <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/who-we-are/our-history/1980s/agricultural-impacts-on-water-quality-1984/\">agricultural practices.</a> Results of participant evaluations are also <a href=\"http://jefferson-center.org/what-we-do/citizen-juries/bias-evaluation/\">available on the website</a>. In 22 of 27 Citizens Juries held by Jefferson Action and the Jefferson Center, not a single participant expressed dissatisfaction with the fairness of the approach.</p><p><a id=\"Process\" name=\"Process\"></a></p><h1>Process</h1><p>The Citizens Jury process features a representative group of citizens who are given sufficient time and information to make informed recommendations on policy issues. A \u201cjury pool\u201d is created by inviting a randomly-selected group of citizens to participate; the final Jury is chosen to represent the ideological viewpoints and demographic characteristics of the larger population. Typically a Citizens Jury consists of 18-24 people and runs for approximately five days. Participants in a Citizens Jury are paid (roughly equal to the average day\u2019s wage in their area--usually $100 to $150), and other expenses are covered (meals, lodging if necessary), as a way of further reducing barriers and encouraging participation from a representative group.</p><p>Once selected, and provided with the main policy question (called a charge), the Jury listens to expert witnesses and deliberates about the issue. The process includes time for the Jurors to question the witnesses directly, and to call back experts they wish to question again. The Jury expresses their final recommendations in their own words and Jurors review the final report before it is made public. The Jury typically chooses some of its members to serve as spokespersons at press conferences or to provide testimony before policymakers.</p><p>Throughout a Citizens Jury, Jurors complete a daily evaluation of the process, including questions designed to assess whether the Jury was conducted in a fair manner. At times the Center has created an Advisory Committee to oversee a Citizens Jury; the Committee includes a range of individuals with different perspectives on the topic that is being deliberated and helps provide a safeguard against bias.</p><p>With their small group size and lengthy time for deliberation, Citizens Juries provide for in-depth discussion of policy issues. Yet by randomly selecting the participants and carefully choosing a Jury that reflects the broader community, it also provides a representation of the community\u2019s demographic characteristics and ideological views. The process is designed to circumvent the \u201cideological noise\u201d that is present in our current policy environment so that ordinary citizens can advise and vote for leaders to create better public policy.</p><p>While the Citizens Jury has been the most successful method developed by the Center, it has experimented with other approaches, such as Extended Policy Discussions with policy experts, or Values Reviews identifying areas of agreement or disagreement among ordinary citizens.</p><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h1>Resources</h1><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Jefferson Center website is <a href=\"http://www.jefferson-center.org/\">www.jefferson-center.org</a></p><p>The website of the Center\u2019s 501(c)(4) nonprofit partner, Jefferson Action, is <a href=\"http://www.jeffersonaction.org/\">www.jeffersonaction.org</a></p><p>For more information on the Citizens Initiative Review process run by Healthy Democracy Oregon and the Healthy Democracy Fund, go to <a href=\"http://www.healthydemocracyoregon.org/\">www.healthydemocracyoregon.org</a> or <a href=\"http://www.healthydemocracyfund.org/\">www.healthydemocracyfund.org</a>.</p>", "geo_city": "St. Paul", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Jefferson Center", "methods": "Citizens&#039; Jury", "path": "/organizations/jefferson-center", "geo_phone": "651-209-7672", "geo_latitude": "44\u00b0 56' 42.378\" N", "additional": "Suite 700", "author_uid": "155", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "93\u00b0 5' 32.7948\" W", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2011-12-13T22:50:26", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2010-06-03T10:54:33", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "261", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "San Antonio Texas", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)||Education &amp; Schools||Economic Development", "body_en": "<a name=\"Organization\" id=\"Organization\"></a><h2>Organization</h2>\n<p>The Common Enterprise  \n</p><p>The Common Enterprise is a national organization, which works to encourage citizens with different backgrounds, party affiliations and beliefs to work together toward common goals. The Common Enterprise has spent several years studying the various successes and failures of various fields\u2014community building, community organizing, leadership development, politics, journalism, facilitation, government, the private sector, foundations, youth work \u2014and then has analyzed this information to assist citizens and their communities to effectively work together . The Common Enterprise is community-building initiative funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Common Enterprise is currently working in \u2013Tucson, San Antonio, San Diego and Portland to bridge the ideological gaps between citizens that prohibit them from reaching common goals within their local community.  Although not a well-known organization, The Common Enterprise has worked within each of these four cities local educational institutions and their local non-profit organizations to support and assist them in effectively deliberating on local issues.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Purpose_and_Problem\" id=\"Purpose_and_Problem\"></a><h2>Purpose and Problem</h2>\n<p>Often the importance of building relationships among citizens is overlooked by a community\u2019s short-term goal of solving a specific issue; however, this shortsightedness is detrimental. Instead, encouraging productive relationships amongst a community\u2019s citizens, allowing them to work together and apply their own strengths to an issue, builds an atmosphere in which a community can grow and productively interact. Thus building the long-term foundation that is necessary for a community to tackle current and future issues. Jaun Sepulveda explains, \u201cAlthough there is always a specific community project to be addressed, the true value lies in recognizing that citizens are helping to create an atmosphere where getting to know one another and working together to tackle the community\u2019s toughest issues become a way of life .\u201d However, getting individuals that rarely interact together and creating a productive conversation is not an easy feat.\n</p><p>Common Enterprise\u2019s purpose and mission is to facilitate such productive interactions and conversations between opposing parties and encourage each party to work collaboratively in their own community. The Common Enterprise strives to step back from situations and assess the factors that are \u201climiting to the ongoing community work of individuals and organizations across the country .\u201d They then utilized this information to assist citizens and organizations to work past differences and successfully join together to better their community. \n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Common Enterprise initiative was formed in 1995. It was organized and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.  It is a national organization as it has studied various organizations around the United States; however, has four central sites from which it works\u2014San Diego, Tucson, San Antonio and Portland. \n</p>\n<a name=\"Research_and_Strategy\" id=\"Research_and_Strategy\"></a><h2>Research and Strategy</h2>\n<p>The Common Enterprise strives to understand the actions and processes that limit citizens and organizations from moving forward in their common endeavors. San Antonio\u2019s previous site director, Juan Sepulveda, references Peter Senge, in his book, The Dance of Change, to explain why The Common Enterprise works to seek out these limiting processes. Senge explains, \u201cWe need to understand the nature of growth processes (forces that aid our efforts) and how to catalyze them. But we also need to understand the forces and challenges that impede progress, and to develop workable strategies for dealing with these challenges. \u201d The Common Enterprise specializes in understanding and then working to correct these limiting processes. \n</p><p>Previous site director for San Antonio, Jaun Sepulveda, explains the common limiting processes that The Common Enterprise recognizes, in his article, The Common Enterprise: A Report from San Antonio, Texas. Jaun Sepulveda highlights four major issues in this report. First Sepulveda explains that more citizens need to be involved. He states, \u201cAlmost every effort with which we have worked has had the same problem: there are never enough people to share the tasks and responsibilities necessary to carry out the work .\u201d Sepulveda then explains this has two consequences; first, those individuals that are involved begin to complain about the workload and begin stereotyping the rest of the community as apathetic and lazy . Second, these volunteers start to believe that they are the only ones who can get the project done and do not seek outside help. As explained by John Gastil, in Political Communication and Deliberation, for productive deliberation it is necessary for a broad-spectrum of ideas to be brainstormed so that the best possible solution can be implemented. However, when only a select number of people are participating in the brainstorming process, the ideas presented will reflect those participating and often neglect to recognize the needs of other groups. The Common Enterprise recognizes that a completely representative group is impossible to create, however, \u201cby focusing on who is not present, we can continue to develop strategies to attract others and offer them innovative ways of participating .\u201d Furthermore, it is important the individuals do not claim to represent factions of the population in which they are not currently a part. Sepulveda explains individuals often do not recruit the minorities that are hard to interest such as, the poor, women and the youth; instead they claim that they can represent these individuals as they are \u201ctheir neighbors\u201d or \u201cthey use to be one of them.\u201d Instead, it is more productive to recognize that these voices are not represented in ones organization and consider how these gaps can be appropriately filled. Furthermore, The Common Enterprise works with organizations to understand that participants should pursue tasks in which they are interested. Sepulveda explains, \u201cWhen there are task forces to be led, subcommittees to be formed, or activities to be assigned and no one volunteers, usually the group stares at each other until someone feels guilty enough to volunteer. But the typical result is that it does not get done at all, or it gets done late or inadequately.\u201d Therefore, the individual\u2019s time was not productively spent. Instead, The Common Enterprise encourages organizations, as community builders, to seek out an individual that is passionate about the position and can effectively perform the task.\n</p><p>The second issue that The Common Enterprise has worked to assist community-building organizations with is to encourage individuals to stop creating an unmanageable workload. Sepulveda explains, \u201cThe group of people working on the added-on community work tries to \ufb01t the new set of activities into an already overburdened, unrealistic work schedule. Work hours are increased, but deadlines are missed, though in fact no one believed there was enough time to accomplish the goals. A silent agreement comes to pass: workers know they cannot complete their work, but they learn how to make it seem as if they are .\u201d This is an unhealthy habit, which can result in individuals becoming so overwhelmed they give up trying to accomplish the objective. Therefore, the original goal is never completed. The Common Enterprise simply asks,  \u201cpotential community volunteers to take a step back and evaluate everything they are already doing\u2014professionally, personally, other volunteer commitments\u2014before they make any commitments to a new project .\u201d Therefore volunteers can enjoy the experience of successfully completing their goals; thus, empowering them to encourage other to be involved. Furthermore, the quality of work done will be visible to the public and encourage bystanders to be involved, as they can perceive that participation in such organizations can have productive results.\n</p><p>The third point that the Common Enterprise stresses the need for organizations to get back to basics. Sepulveda explains, \u201cTo have true community impact, an organization cannot forget the basics. Without the basics, there are no advanced issues to worry about because it will end up spending a great deal of its time reacting and trying to resolve the fundamental questions .\u201d Therefore, before an organization moves on to complicated projects they must make sure they have their fundamental principles are clarified. As explained by Gastil in Political Commuication and Deliberation for a viable solution to be selected, a clear set of criteria must be decided on to assess the potential solution and its ability to meet the goals strived for by the committee. \n</p><p>The final point that the Common Enterprise seeks to implement is for citizens to \u201clearn globally, act locally\u201d. Sepulveda explains, \u201cthe\u2026message we need to send is that community groups are not doing their job locally if they are not continuously learning from the efforts of others across the city, the country, and the rest of the world, and taking these resources and applying them to their local actions .\u201d The Common Enterprise explains that it is important for organizations to look to other organizations to see how they have solved their problems; thus, allowing them to learn from each other. When organizations do not learn from each other Sepulveda explains, \u201cthe result is that many community efforts constantly reinvent the wheel, do not build on the successes and failures of the past, and believe that their local conditions are so unique that they must take on their tasks as though no one else has ever faced these sets of challenges .\u201d The Common Enterprise has helped develop two different strategies to help citizens and organization to keep learning. The fist is coined the codification strategy\u2014this strategy \u201cfocuses on capturing the knowledge, experiences, and lessons of individuals and groups that are working on basic, fundamental issues\u2014the type of issues that many companies will face in their lifetime .\u201d This information is then stored on databases which all members of the organization have easy access, therefore, eliminating the need for specific individuals to be sought out to answer questions. The second option The Common Enterprise has encouraged is the personalization approach, \u201cHere, the focus is not on databases but on networks of individuals who can be tapped to tackle challenging problems creatively\u2014problems that go beyond the basic issues faced by organizations.\u201d Here Common Enterprise strives to have knowledgeable non-profit organizations utilize their knowledge of strategic consulting and help communities to learn and implement this knowledge.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2>\n<p>The Common Enterprise works in four cities in the United States: San Diego, San Antonio, Portland and Tucson.

The current project director is Sharif Abdulluh. It is now a direct grantee of the Rockefeller Foundation. The Three Valley Project worked to create an understanding and create community and civic engagement between citizens from different cultures that live in the three valleys. The Three Valleys Project focused on small towns located in the Hood River Valley, Mid-Willamette Valley and Tualatin Valley. The focus of this project was to assist in helping these communities interact with each other as they experience a large demographic change. \n\n</p>\n<a name=\"\" id=\"\"></a><h2> Three principal goals for the project\u00a0: </h2>\n<p>  \n</p>\n<a name=\"__Embracing_A_Multi-Cultural_Reality\" id=\"__Embracing_A_Multi-Cultural_Reality\"></a><h2> 1:  Moving Beyond Fear:  Embracing A Multi-Cultural Reality </h2>\n<p>-Reducing racism, cultural antagonism and social isolation.   \n-Building cultural diversity and sensitivity.\n</p>\n<a name=\"___Generating_A_Civic_Dialog\" id=\"___Generating_A_Civic_Dialog\"></a><h2> 2:   Generating A Civic Dialog </h2>\n<p>-Facilitating the creation and expansion of a larger civic community.   \n-Helping all of the people who live in a given area become full participate citizens of that area.\n</p>\n<a name=\"___Encouraging_Systemic_Change\" id=\"___Encouraging_Systemic_Change\"></a><h2> 3:   Encouraging Systemic Change </h2>\n<p>-Addressing systemic and institutional problems challenging true multi-cultural citizenship in the Valleys. \nThese goals were progressed toward through a series of roundtables in which facilitators and translators meet with citizens and worked with them to reach consensus and gain mutual respect for each other\u2019s cultures.

The organization which is located in Washington D.C. supports democratic change and advocates for human rights. Furthermore, the Freedom House supports the growth of democracy by urging policy makers, international institutions, and governments worldwide to support human rights and democracy by adopting innovative policies that promote the advancement of progressive ideologies. These ideals are supported by their mission statement, which declares: \n</p><p>Freedom House, an independent nongovernmental organization, supports the expansion of freedom in the world. Freedom is possible only in democratic political systems in which the governments are accountable to their own people; the rule of law prevails; and freedoms of expression, association, and belief, as well as respect for the rights of minorities and women, are guaranteed.  Freedom ultimately depends on the actions of committed and courageous men and women. We support nonviolent civic initiatives  in societies where freedom is denied or under threat and we stand in opposition to ideas and forces that challenge the right of all people to be free. Freedom House functions as a catalyst for freedom, democracy and the rule of law through its analysis, advocacy and action.\n</p><p>The Freedom House is recognized worldwide as a source of defining the state of freedom around the globe; this is accomplished through its many publications. Freedom in the World is an annual report that assesses the state of political rights of 192 countries and 14 territories. The annual report is just one of the many publications that seek to bring to light the importance of current democratic and human rights worldwide. The organization combines the words advocacy, power, and action as core mission values for freedom worldwide.\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Freedom House was established in 1941 with the support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a means of encouraging American involvement and support during World War II. Moreover, the foundation of the Freedom House can be accredited to the American fear of Nazism and the spread of Communism worldwide. During the early years, the board of trustees was made up of scholars from diverse backgrounds such as journalists, business and labor leaders, former governmental leaders, and academics. The variety of educational backgrounds along with abundances of differential experiences created bipartisanship within the organization. One of the earliest board members was that of Eleanor Roosevelt who, much like her husband, was a strong supporter of the Freedom House. The earliest members believed that the creation of the organization would be the best weapon to use to ensure the spread of Democracy and the elimination of totalitarianism and Communism; thus, the mission to ensure human rights across the globe and the values of Democracy became vital for the organization. Moreover, the Freedom House encouraged any pro-democratic institutions; following the war, the organization endorsed the Atlantic Alliance and NATO. \nThe 1950s brought along an era of intensified fear of the spread of Communism and even more, the fear of being labeled a Communist. Not surprisingly, the Freedom House advocated against McCarthyism and remand on the pursuit of spreading democracy worldwide. At the same time, the organization continued its humanity efforts through being early supporters of the Civil Rights movement. In 1973, the Freedom House reached a milestone as it published its first edition of \u201cFreedom in the World\u201d which measured the level of freedom throughout the world on an annual basis. Today the Freedom House continues to serve as leading advocates for humanity with the progressive ideologies of democracy and remains a strong voice for foreign policy and global freedom.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Specializations_and_Activities\" id=\"Specializations_and_Activities\"></a><h2>Specializations and Activities</h2>\n<p>Currently the Freedom House is actively pursuing their mission of democratic change worldwide. At this time, the organization is primarily focused on the following regions: Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Some of the organizations activities include: promoting women rights in the Middle East and Northern Africa, conducting workshops on for the new Iraqi Constitution, and promoting freedom expansion worldwide. Moreover, the Freedom House is also leaders in an international exchange program. The international exchange programs are vital to the success of the organization because it allows for the process of establishing Freedom Houses across the globe and assists in the effort to expand freedom worldwide. The Freedom House offers three different kinds of exchange programs all of which focus on experiencing freedom and democracy. The Visiting Fellows Program offers participants from new and transitioning governments the chance to learn and understand how a democracy works. The Study Tour Program brings democratic together advocates, journalist, and public officials together to deliberate and discuss alternative views of government in an effort to gain an enhanced knowledge of democracy. Lastly, the International Executive Volunteer Program assists new democracies with hands on skill training. This is conducted through the technical assistance of the media, civic, and governmental and is guided by experienced professionals. The Freedom House is actively involved in global politics and is striving to be strong advocated for equality, freedom, and humanity worldwide.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>The Freedom House is a non-profit, nonpartisan organization that relies solely on individual donors worldwide. Donor support is critical in the effort to promote freedom globally. Individual donors can donate online or send donations to Freedom House headquarters in Washington D.C. All donations are tax-deductible. In 2007, the organizations total net assets added up to $8.21 million. A few of the donors that contributed at least $250,000 include The Australian Agency for International Development, Government of the Netherlands, and the U.S. Department of State.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Publications\" id=\"Publications\"></a><h2>Publications</h2>\n<p>The Freedom House distributes numerous publications annually with the most prominent survey being the \u201cFreedom in the World\u201d which is a comparative assessment of global politics and civil liberties. Beginning in 1972, \u201cFreedom in the World\u201d assesses the degree of freedom in 193 countries and 14 territories worldwide. Each country is ranked as free, partially free, or not free; each country is surveyed by numerous political scientists. Furthermore, each country is ranked numerically on a 1-7 scale with 1 being most free and 7 being least free. In order for a country to be classified as free it must receive a score from 1-2.5, partially free 3-5, and not free 5.5-7. The survey is used worldwide as a reference for policy making, the media, international corporations, civic activists, and human rights leaders.   \n</p><p>Global Trends \n</p><p>Since the survey began in 1972, the overall trend has been that a higher percentage of countries are becoming more free and throughout the years, many countries have transformed from \u201cnot free\u201d to being classified as a \u201cfree.\u201d In 1976 only 26% of all countries were free and 43% were labeled as not free. However, in 2008, the Freedom House reported that there had been a decline in freedom worldwide. One concern for the decline is because of the political disturbances and democratic regression in the following countries: Russia, Pakistan, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria and Venezuela. A significant portion of countries in Asia also had setbacks in 2008 according to the Freedom House. Due to increased restrictions on civil society and increased military activity Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have all regressed on their pursue for total freedom. Thailand, on the other hand actually progressed on the freedom scale; because of national election, Thailand transformed from \u201cnot free\u201d in 2007 to \u201cpartially free\u201d in 2008. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Beginning in 1980, the Freedom House began to survey the \u201cFreedom of the Press\u201d which is dedicated to ensuring freedom of the media in the world. According to organization, \u201ca free press plays a key role in sustaining and monitoring a healthy democracy, as well as in contributing to greater accountability, good government, and economic development.\u201d Much like \u201cFreedom in the World\u201d each country is ranked on the same scale; free, partially free, or not free. The survey includes print, broadcast, and the internet when measuring the degree of freedom. In the most recent publication of the 195 countries ranked, 37% were deemed free, 59% partially free, and 64% were rated as not free. Other prominent Freedom House publication include, \u201cNations in Transit\u201d, \u201cCountries at the Crossroads\u201d, \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights Survey\u201d, and \u201cFreedom on the Net.\u201d\n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects\" id=\"Major_Projects\"></a><h2>Major Projects</h2>\n<p>The Freedom House is committed to ensuring the spread of democracy and freedom worldwide. In an effort to accomplish this mission, the organization\u2019s leaders are strong global advocates. Organization leaders are constantly working with democratic reformers in many countries as they strive to transform the country\u2019s government.   The organization has currently begun a deliberative program started in May 2010, called the Debate Program which is \u201cdedicated to promoting discussion on human rights and democracy issues in Latin America\u201d according to the Freedom House website. Since the organizations foundation in 1941, a major issue has been to spark debate on global democracy and human rights. Another prominent program that kicked off in May 2010 is aimed to support media freedom in Uganda. The country is currently approaching presidential elections and as a result the Uganda government has proposed an amendment to silence the media. The bill would significantly limit the freedom of speech within the country.

It makes it easy to obtain informed opinions on the budget in question as well as giving views on what is important regarding the budget; For example, whether to increase or decrease spending on a certain expenditure. It also allows to engage people who are hard to reach or sustain attention from, such as the lack of attentiveness that may arise from a regular, \u201cboring\u201d meeting. The cost of engaging so many people is done at minimal cost.\n</p><p>2.Dialogue App or Dialogue Platform: \n</p><p>This product allows for the sharing of ideas, online dynamic interaction (similar to Twitter or FaceBook) and the gathering of customer feedback. It is ideal for crowd-sourcing and promoting innovation and ideas exchange, running debates on issues that your community cares about.

Citizen Space (renamed from Opinion Suite) \n</p><p>Out of these four major products offered, this one is the only one that has the potential to be used at no cost. The only costs that would be charged to an account would be for those services the owner needs, such as set up, hosting, customization, maintenance, support or advice. Being an open source product it also allows for easy management as well as customization for the organization using it  . \n</p><p>An example of how a standard partnership may work includes the initial \u2018Consultation design\u2019 which is emphasizing the questions that need to be answered by the organization or enlighten the problems that need to be addressed. Background information is also acquired and as well as distribution of all policy documents and multimedia resources available. After all of the information is gathered then the \u2018Consultation distribution\u2019 phase is enabled where the delivery of the online and paper surveys are distributed. Paper surveys are offered to give the company more options on their research method. Once, this is done, phase three of the \u2018Stakeholder engagement and recruitment\u2019 begins. This includes recruiting participants, publicizing the products that have been chosen to be used as well as to hold events to further advertise and bring awareness of the actions to be taken. Phase four of \u2018Data entry and coding\u2019 is the cost efficient input of the results of the offline surveys. Phase five of \u2018Report writing and statistical analysis\u2019 is the complete analysis and report of the data collected which also includes publications to the stakeholders. The final phase is \u2018Consultancy\u2019 where advice is given and specialist project management is offered. \n</p><p>Citation:\n</p><p>Budget Simulator.

London Fire Brigade (2009) Draft Fourth London Safety Plan ( since closed for any more responses)\n</p><p>From November 30th 2009 to February 22 2010 the London Fire Brigade consulted on the draft of the London Safety Plan 2010/13. This was the fourth London Safety Plan and explains how the Brigade plan to build on its reputation as one of the world\u2019s leading fire \nand  rescue services. All responses were assessed and taken into consideration by the Authority at its meeting in March 2010. The views helped decide upon the content of the final plan, which was published in April 2010 on our website at\n<a href=\"http://www.london-fire.gov.uk\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.london-fire.gov.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.london-fire.gov.uk</a>. \n</p><p>The Plan includes a shake up of where some specialist vehicles and equipment are located across the capital. This is to deliver greater efficiency and improvement in the way equipment is deployed and firefighters are trained. It also includes new performance \ntargets, which will see the Brigade aim to reduce fires, which damage property, reduce arson and reduce the number of unwanted calls we attend.\n</p><p>Community Safety: We work to help people stay safe from fire and other emergencies, in the home, at work and in London\u2019s other buildings. Accidental fires in the home are the main cause of fire deaths and we do all we can to reduce these fatalities. We work to educate people about what they can do to protect themselves from fire. We do this by:  \n</p><p>1. Home fire safety visits - firefighters visiting people in their homes to give advice on fire safety and fitting smoke alarms for free if necessary.\n</p><p>2. Working with other organisations who work with people we know are most at risk from fires and help us to reach and protect them.\n</p><p>3. Informing people at a young age about the dangers of fire, how they can protect themselves and the consequences of making hoax calls. We have successful and award winning initiatives to do this, including a schools team.\n</p><p>4. Reducing deliberately started fires - we have a specialist team to tackle fire setting behavior by young people and another working with partners to reduce fire related crime.\n</p><p>5. Advising on fire safety in the workplace - as an employer you are responsible for making sure you and your staff know what to do to prevent a fire in the workplace and how to escape if a fire does break out.\n</p><p>6. Carry out inspections of buildings - to improve the safety of the buildings we work with  developers at an early stage, carry out inspections to make sure they meet fire regulations, and we take enforcement action when necessary.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Case_Studies\" id=\"Case_Studies\"></a><h2>Case Studies</h2>\n<p>Delib is dedicated to help their clients excel in their efforts of helping the communities and businesses.

Craig and is a non-profit organization who's headquarters are in Keystone, Colorado with other offices in Denver and Washington, DC. The main purpose of the Keystone Center is to seek ways to solve our society's most demanding environment, energy and public health problems. The Center looks to bring together today's public, private and civic sector leaders to address these issues and also to equip the next generation with knowledge and the social skills required to effectively take on questions they will face in the future.</p><p>The Keystone Center specializes in helping community, government, and business leaders acquire the scientific, social, economic, and political information they need to make sound decisions. More specifically, The Keystone Center helps the public, private, and civic sectors use scientific knowledge and state-of-the-art consensus-building in the areas of environmental, health, and energy policy. We accomplish this through independent facilitation and mediation services on a range of significant policy issues. <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://keystone.org/files/file/about/Statement_of_Independence.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://keystone.org/files/file/about/Statement_of_Independence.pdf\">http://keystone.org/files/file/about/Statement_of_Independence.pdf</a>.</p><p>The Center for Science and Public Policy is one of two Centers that Keystone contains. This center has been aiding public, private, and civic-sector leaders solve difficult issues and achieve quality public policy since 1975. Center for Science and Public Policy relies on their independence, commitment to ample science, and skills in designing and leading consensus-building procedures to create new partnerships, diminish conflict and create policy agreements. Energy, Environment and Health and Social Policy are the three areas of policy this center specializes in. The center works on a range of issues on energy, which include; climate change and clean energy; electricity generation and markets; energy infrastructure; energy planning; renewable energy and energy efficiency; and transportation. In addition to individually-funded projects, the Keystone Center hosts the Keystone Energy Board. This board is a long standing forum for representatives across the energy spectrum to learn about and debate on energy issues most citizens' face today. Each of the meetings brings together experts and knowledgeable leaders in the field and showcases confidential deliberation that usually lead to new Keystone Dialogues and membership into this board is by invitation only.</p><p>Environment is the Keystone Center's second area of policy, which can range from local to international; from two parties with a single issue to complex deliberation involving multiple parties over multiple issues. In each of these cases the center uses its neutral and independent facilitation in helping people solve issues and make knowledgeable decisions. They serve as a trusted bridge between those with a wide range of perspectives on a large array of environmental policy, legislative, and regulatory questions, including: collaborative resource management; ecosystem and watershed management; natural resource protection; water quality and quantity issues; sustainable agriculture; green marketing; transportation; climate change; restoration and remediation; and resource extraction and use (mining, forestry, and sustainable development).</p><p>The third area is Health and Social Policy where the center works with a wide range of stakeholders to create consensus solutions to intricate health and social policy challenges. They design, amass and facilitate nation policy dialogues, stakeholder advisory boards, fact-finding, and peer-exchange forums, public-input processes, coalition-building processes, conflict assessments, and training workshops. A short list of client organizations includes: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Richard Lounsbery Foundation, DuPont, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Keystone Center also works on policy problems in the areas of: medicine; health care; food and nutrition; workplace safety and health; environmental health; and chronic and infectious diseases.</p><p>Center for Education is the second part of the Keystone Center. At this center, they work with students, teachers, and communities to stimulate critical thinking through physical touch and scientific questioning. The center is committed to increasing awareness and understanding of the real world and to provide students of all ages and abilities with the best skills needed to investigate and solve problems. <a id=\"Specializations_and_Activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_Activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and Activities</h2><p>The Center for Science and Public Policy offers the following customized services: The Keystone Dialogues, which identify policy questions ready for deliberation, then frame the questions, bring the stakeholders together, and then finally help them build a consensus that will lead to real results. The dialogues are carefully created deliberative meetings that address politically controversial and technically complex parts of an issue being examined. The policy dialogue seeks to exchange information and build consensus recommendations between public, private, and civic sector thought leaders who are in a position to create alliances, make decisions, or strongly influence the trajectory of a possible challenging issue. These dialogues bring unique interest groups to the table, focus on regulatory, policy, or planning issue that is on popular interest, are usually guided by a facilitator or mediator, have a life cycle with a beginning, middle and end, and seek to formulate practical solutions to difficult problems.</p><p>Facilitation and mediation is another customized service offered, which brings parties together to find the answers to problems, reach agreements, make plans and resolve conflicts. The mediators of the Keystone Center are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in public policy conflict resolution and consensus building. The staff has convened and facilitated important agreement-focused dialogues, helping government leaders bring stakeholders together to solve difficult and controversial healthcare, energy and environment problems. The center has facilitated national policymaking processes, statewide consensus-building efforts and local decision-making discussions.</p><p>Public participation and stakeholder engagement is designing and executing public meetings to gather input, share information or announce agency choices. The public expects to hear from government officials before, during and after and agency makes a large and important decision. The Keystone Center's facilitators have designed and delivered public engagement processes that increase the quality of public policy, give officials access to information from the members of the public, give the public vital information about the purpose for government action and allow for careful consideration of other options. They can turn a potentially negative public meeting into thoughtful venues for dialogue and deliberation. The center has helped the local government reach other to its community members and federal agencies. In the process the center has improved communication, subdued fears, corrected misunderstandings, sorted out issues of community values and set the stage for agencies to create plausible solutions. <a id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2><p>Under the Center for Education are the Keystone Educational Excellence Programs, which mold education communities around the world with the development and dissemination of on-biased, hands-on, interdisciplinary curriculum. With the support from public, private and corporate partners, the center works with educators to improve the education of science and instill in today's students a better understanding of the real work and equipped with the tools needed to solve future complex problems.</p><p>The Keystone Science School is a residential field science school that challenges students to develop critical thinking skills as they explore nature and science education. making extensive use of the outdoor laboratory around us, the center promotes inquiry and sensitivity to the natural environment.</p><p>The center understands that today's youth are this countries future leaders, the ones who will develop policies and make decisions that impact our world. The center has created interactive science education programs that help the students become familiar with scientific and critical thinking skills and promote them to be engaged citizens.</p><p>Between November 2005 and June 2007, a team from The Keystone Center helped to organize and put into action a multiparty negotiation that aimed to increase redress for people affected by river contamination from the Ok Tedi Mine in Papua New Guinea. This river is said to be the worst man-made environment problems in the world and is a true sustainability problem. After an 18 month period of efforts, a major accomplishment was reached.</p><p>Delegates from the nine affected regions surrounding the river, the mining company, the government, and others concluded a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that will eventually give the people in the affected area about 1.1 billion kina (about $350 million US) in funds, projects and services. <a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>The Keystone Center receives 49.4% of its funding from fees/ earned income; this is the largest percentage of its funding. 38.9% of its funding comes from corporate supporters; 5.7% from events held to raise funds for the center; 4.7% from foundations; .8% from individual pockets; .3% is government funded; and .2% is interest/ miscellaneous income. <a id=\"External_Links\" name=\"External_Links\"></a></p><h2>External Links</h2><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://keystone.org/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://keystone.org/home\">http://keystone.org/home</a></p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.keystone.org/science-public-policy\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.keystone.org/science-public-policy\">http://www.keystone.org/science-public-policy</a></p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.keystone.org/education\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.keystone.org/education\">http://www.keystone.org/education</a></p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://keystone.org/files/file/about/annual-report/KeystoneCenter-2008-annual-E-EDITION.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://keystone.org/files/file/about/annual-report/KeystoneCenter-2008-annual-E-EDITION.pdf\">http://keystone.org/files/file/about/annual-report/KeystoneCenter-2008-annual-E-EDITION.pdf</a></p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.thataway.org/?p=982\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.thataway.org/?p=982\">http://www.thataway.org/?p=982</a></p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "The Keystone Center", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/keystone-center", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "39\u00b0 36' 36.6768\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "101", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "105\u00b0 57' 52.7544\" W", "fulltime_staff": "51", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2011-12-14T01:52:28", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Daniel Yankelovich", "post_date": "2010-06-04T04:12:09", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "265", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "New York, NY", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Education &amp; Schools||Budgeting||Economic Development||Environment||Health||Immigration||National &amp; International Security||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<p>Public Agenda is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization in the United States that undertakes ongoing issues and \u201cprovides citizens and leaders the tools they need to tackle them.\u201d PublicAgenda is afflicted with multiple sources that all focus on ensuring that public\u2019s views are represented in decision-making. On their online website, PublicAgenda.org, which is an issues guide and a citizen\u2019s survival kit, they inform citizens about issues and ways they can engage and participate in making a change. Public Agenda is also engaged through social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter to better engage with the community. Public Agenda is also betrothed with communities around the country to help citizens understand and deliberate on tough issues. On their main webpage, PublicAgenda.org, they also publish regular blog entries and research on a number of domestic issues. Many journalist, policymakers, teachers, students and citizens rely on Public Agenda\u2019s nonbiased issues guide for information and different perspectives in analyzing issues. Public Agenda covers a vast range of issues from education, citizen rights, and energy to federal budget, health care, immigration and more. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Public Agenda was founded in 1975 by social scientist and author, Daniel Yankelovich, and secretary of state, Cyrus Vance. For over 35 years, Public Agenda has aimed to fulfill two main missions which is for: American leaders to better understand the public's point of view, and citizens to know more about critical policy issues so they can make thoughtful, informed decisions.</p><p>Since then, PublicAgenda.org has been nominated twice for the prestigious Webby Award as one of the Internet's best sources for balanced, accurate information on public policy issues and has participated with many different communities and partnered with many organizations to better inform the nation, so they can make higher quality and greater decisions on ongoing issues. <a id=\"Specializations_and_Activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_Activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and Activities</h2><p>Public Agenda is associated with many different public engagement projects and community forums to help the nation\u2019s citizens come together to better deliberate and collaborate on difficult issues.</p><p>One of the projects was the Citizen Engagement And Community Transformation in Bridgeport, CT. In 1996, the Bridgeport Public Education Fund (BPEF) joined a national demonstration project led by Public Agenda and the Institute for Educational Leadership (IEL) to explore possibilities for public dialogue about education reform among diverse stakeholders.</p><p>In the spring of 2004, Public Agenda participated in the Nebraskans Weigh in on Essential Educational Opportunities for All Students. The Nebraska State Board of Education was looking for a way to allow a cross-section of residents to weigh in on the recommendations they had developed and laid out in a document called Equitable Opportunities For an Essential Education For All Students-Recommendations for Nebraska Public School Districts.Public Agenda had helped the state board connected hundreds of Nebraskans to discuss the controversial question of statewide standards. Parents, students, educators and community members participated in Choicework discussion forums where they wrestled with various approaches to the standards issue. Building off the results of these discussions, the state board was able to adopt new statewide guidelines. In the end, Public Agenda conducted focus groups and helped selected districts facilitate discussion forums with more than 370 parents, students, educators (teachers, principals and superintendents) and members of the general public that represented roughly 25 districts.</p><p>In 2004, Public Agenda conducted fieldwork in New Haven, Connecticut; San Antonio, Texas; and New York City, which was support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the New York Community Trust. This project was called the Straight Talk/Street Talk: Possibilities for Dialogue Between Communities and the Police. They interviewed numerous law enforcement officials, from patrol officers to upper brass, and held 12 focus groups with various kinds of residents. They also developed four new Choicework guides (Preventing Crime, Promoting Public Safety; Improving Police-Community Relations; Ensuring School Safety and Preventing Terrorism and Protecting Civil Liberties) that were used to structure five dialogue sessions held across the three sites.</p><p>In September 2003 Public Agenda launched the project of Addressing Property Tax Reform in New Jersey. Public Agenda helped the Coalition for the Public Good, a New Jersey based grass-roots organization, to organize and conducted a major statewide \"Citizen's Tax Assembly,\" a two-day event held in the capitol building in Trenton. The New Jersey Citizens' Tax Assembly brought together close to 100 diverse \"delegates\" from every county in the state to engage one another in a dialogue on possible approaches to tax reform.</p><p>Public Agenda helped in creating a different kind of forum in which residents from across the state could engage complex questions of tax reform and reveal that reasonable solutions are possible. Public Agenda carried out focus groups with Anglo parents, bilingual Hispanic parents, Spanish-only Hispanic parents, students of various backgrounds, and teachers on the topics of student achievement, diversity, and equity, for the Standards in San Jose, California project. One district official called the findings \"an eye-opening experience\" because parents of all backgrounds, along with students themselves, called for high expectations for student achievement. In response, the school board raised its graduation requirements. The district then moved on to a broad-based community conversation about \"Standards and Expectations for Our Students\" with Public Agenda assisting by training conversation organizers and moderators, and by developing discussion materials. Although the district initiated and sponsored the forum, a committee that included parents, members of the clergy, employers and others took over the planning and operations. The forum, held at a downtown church, drew about 140 participants; some discussions were conducted in Spanish with translated materials and a bilingual moderator and recorder. The National School Public Relations Association awarded the district a top award for its public engagement model.</p><p>In the 1990's research commissioned by the Graustein Memorial Fund in Connecticut and conducted by Public Agenda revealed significant gaps between the general public, community leaders and educators concerning the problems facing Connecticut's schools, which resulted to the Changing the Conversation on Education in Connecticut project. To kick off the project, hundreds of organizations--school districts, parent groups, community-based organizations, etc., were invited to participate. Initially, eight local sponsors were chosen, covering 17 towns. By design, they were to work as a network to build statewide capacity for civic dialogues on the range of issues facing Connecticut's schools. Each site was funded and received technical assistance from Public Agenda. Since then, over 70 cities and towns across the state have participated and the initiative continues to grow. <a id=\"Major_Projects\" name=\"Major_Projects\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects</h2><p><a id=\"FacingUp\" name=\"FacingUp\"></a></p><h3>FacingUp</h3><p>FacingUp.org is a nationwide project that is in partnership with Public Agenda to enable more Americans to confront and work through realistic choices for addressing the nation's long-term fiscal challenges.

Also, before the initial assessment is executed, the organization requires an invitation or recommendation from individuals, organizations or governments in order to get involved in specific conflicts. Upon the completion of these two steps, the HD Centre will engage in mediation (as to ensure effective deliberation) in hopes of reducing the consequences of conflict and to come up with a peaceful resolution. Such projects include conflicts in Sudan, Philippines (NDF), Myanmar/Burma, the Central African Republic, Timor-Leste, Kenya and Somalia. <a id=\"Publications\" name=\"Publications\"></a></p><h2>Publications</h2><p>Davis, Mike, ed.

Purpose and Mission of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform:</h2><p>The purpose and mission of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform is to challenge to the nation to improve public education in America by enhancing the quality of learning for youth in urban communities across the country. </p><h2>II. History of the AISR:</h2><p>In 1993, Brown University of Providence, Rhode Island received an anonymous gift of five million dollars. This is significant for two reasons: one, who in the world gives a five million dollar gift anonymously and where can I find friends like these? And two, this is what funded the take-off for the Annenberg Institute for School Reform project. [1] The first director of the Institute, Dr. Theodore R. Sizer, had previously founded and been chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools. The Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) forefronts the movement to create and sustain personalized and intellectually-challenging schools [6]. The CES specializes in supporting student achievement and promoting innovative teaching styles. Dr. Sizer built upon this idea with an even broader mission: \u201cto support sustained, focused efforts to enhance the quality of learning of children and youth across the country.\u201d Later, following the retirement of Dr. Sizer in October of 1998, a new executive director was appointed: the then-director of the Philadelphia Education Fund, Dr. Warren Simmons. It was during this time that the AISR adopted the mission statement that it currently acts under to date, with an emphasis on concentrating critical needs to improving public schools in the urban communities of our country.</p><p>a. The Challenge:<br />A few months after the birth of \u201cThe Institute\u201d as it is appears to be lovingly nicknamed, another donor felt particularly generous and decided to contribute an additional fifty million dollar gift. This was a part of Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg\u2019s 500-million dollar \u201cChallenge to the Nation,\u201d which was to improve education in America. The \u201cChallenge to the Nation\u201d is the largest public/private undertaking solely dedicated to improving public schools in the history of the United States. Over 35 states have adopted \u201cChallenge\u201d projects focused on serving students and teachers through the funds of private donations from contributors such as businesses, universities, foundations, and various individuals. [2] Each of the \u201cChallenge\u201d projects has to fit within the unique conditions of its local site. The directors are able to ensure that this happens through conducting local planning groups made up of education staff, business leaders, foundation officers, and other community members. These governing boards were given the responsibility and privilege of running the projects. In order to fully understand the Annenberg Institute for School Reform project (AISR), it is important to know the background of the \u201cChallenge.\u201d The \u201cChallenge\u201d is responsible for awarding millions of dollars worth of grants to subprojects such as the AISR, with fifty-million donated so far. In a sense, the \u201cChallenge\u201d is the \u201cbig picture\u201d that is hoped to be achieved through secondary organizations much like the AISR.</p><p>b. Influential Founder:<br />Aside from knowing about the \u201cChallenge,\u201d it is also necessary to mention the man who made the whole cause possible, founder Walter H. Annenberg. Annenberg was born in March of 1908 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to lower-class Prussian immigrants. His parents eventually became millionaires from publishing controversial periodicals such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily Racing Form, and the Morning Telegraph. He served as US Ambassador to Britain for five years, from 1969 to 1974 [5]. After his father died, Annenberg inherited the family\u2019s Triangle Publications, Inc. and decided to take the trio in a different direction. He used this platform to successfully found Seventeen Magazine in 1944 as well as develop the TV Guide, and own several broadcast TV and stations. After proposing and donating 500-million dollars to the \u201cChallenge\u201d as well as donating an additional 365 million to various prep schools and universities, it is no surprise that Annenberg was considered one of the largest philanthropists to education in his time, earning numerous prestigious honors and awards. In appreciation of all of the generous gifts Annenberg gave in support of the AISR, the Institute was renamed in his honor after his death in 2002 at age 94. </p><h2>III. Project:</h2><p>For public engagement, the AISR has created television programs that are designed to link together large groups, sometimes of several hundred people [7]. In 1999, a video workshop put on by the AISR was offered for K-12 teachers, administrators, and parents in order to discuss critical issues in school reform. The AISR has provided eight different video programs that run from about 30-56 minutes long, a workshop guide, as well as a website [8]. Through these media resources, individuals are able to see first-hand how schools and their communities are talking and deliberating about school reform. The primary focus is turning this talk into action by adapting, implementing, and even inventing new tools in order to make actual improvements in student achievement. From the comfort of one\u2019s own home, the workshop takes viewers to eight different places across the country, showing teachers, parents, administrators, civic leaders, and other representatives collaborating on innovative practices in regards to \u201cpublic engagement and professional development.\u201d The eight different locations include schools in Boston, Missouri, Baltimore, Pasadena, New Hampshire, Virginia, San Bruno, and Massachusetts.</p><p>The topics are just as diverse as the variety of locations. Deliberative conversations center on topics from school subjects such as math and science, to other learning factors, like teaching styles, educational challenges, and family cooperation. Each video goes about investigating and discussing these themes in a different way. For example, the teachers at a high school in Pasadena, California do so by using a peer-observation process where the teachers observe one another in their respective classrooms, and then meet both individually and in groups in order to offer their feedback. This results in ways to improve the relation between teaching practice and student achievement. At an elementary school in Boston, teachers and staff aim to enhance student success through close collaboration with the families of students. A Massachusetts school does it differently still: teachers share sample works of her students with a group of teachers , administrators, and parents in a facilitated \u201cconsultancy\u201d that focuses on a specific question posed by the teacher about both student work and her own teaching style. </p><h2>IV. Funding:</h2><p>As a parent organization of numerous institutes, the \u201cChallenge\u201d is known for offering funds to many of the groups that it has helped create. The Annenberg Institute for School Reform was actually the first recipient of monetary funds from the Annenberg Challenge. At a 50-million dollar price tag, these funds were delegated as an operating and endowment grant. The two organizations were involved in setting guidelines and designing parameters that would dictate how much would go toward Challenge grants at local sites, and how much would go toward evaluating the nationwide efforts of the Challenge. The AISR itself does not play a role in selecting grant recipients, or of allocating the funds. This is the sole responsibility of the overall Annenberg Foundation. The Foundation is in charge of handling all funds and delegating where they go for every project that it oversees. The individual organizations focus exclusively on their missions of improving conditions and outcomes in American schools and education. [3] Different projects and activities put on by the AISR are made possible through the donations of many important funders. These include the likes of certain organizations, programs, schools and universities, as well as private citizens. Some of the biggest donors are the Academy for Educational Development (AED), Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Collaborative Communications Group (CCG), the Community Involvement Program at New York University, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. <a id=\"V..09Activities\" name=\"V..09Activities\"></a></p><h2>V. Activities</h2><p>As a part of the AISR\u2019s ongoing mission to improve public education for American youth, there are plenty of reoccurring activities dedicated to meeting this goal. The AISR aims to inspire \u201ccommunity organizing and engagement\u201d by bringing together citizens from all walks of life: parents, students of all ages, civic officials, businesses, community agencies, cultural institutions, and ordinary average Joe\u2019s to name a few. They then build an understanding within these groups of educational issues in order to advocate for and participate in school-improvement issues. They do this via a few different projects. One of the biggest is the National League of Cities (NLC) Public Engagement Partnership project. With this, the AISR conducted national surveys for promising public engagement strategies in urban settings in order to find what worked best. This review paired the input of the public with an ongoing association of the Education Policy Advisors Network (EPAN) in order to help provide city officials with tools and resources they would need to prepare case studies. This includes developing new tools for civic engagement and utilizes site-based technical support.</p><p>Another large activity that is currently going on is the Schools for a New Society Initiative (SNS). This was created in the year 2000 where different districts received funding to restructure their junior high schools. [4] It was designed to spark collaboration between students, parents, officials, and teachers. There are many highlights that have resulted from this project, one being the planned and facilitated cross-site learning network among citizens in the different districts. This is an annual event that lasts three days and is hosted by the SNS Learning Institute branch. A spin-off of this occurred in the New England region in a two-day meeting in which cross-high school visits took place. An electronic newsletter named Adolescent Literacy Matters was also distributed and shared information on resources, events, strategies, and materials for learning styles. <a id=\"VI..09Publications\" name=\"VI..09Publications\"></a></p><h2>VI. Publications</h2><p>For the Annenberg Institute for School Reform, publications are very important. They help get the word out about their cause in the hopes of getting more participation and feedback.

Although the organization is not associated with the Democratic Party, it is understood that the members of the forum support democratic and progressive philosophy and candidates running for or in any type of political office.  In accordance with their strong criticism of the Republican Party, one of the most popular applications of the website is the \u201cTop Ten Conservative Idiots\u201d list.  With about 25,000 message postings a day, Democratic Underground is a sizable online community with the purpose of promoting liberal deliberation.\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2> History </h2>\n<p>Democratic Underground was founded by David Allen and Dave Allsopp.  The website was  launched on January 20th, 2001, the same day as the Inauguration of Republican President George W. Bush for his first term as president.  The founding date of the website is no coincidence, primarily in the way that the website was created specifically to openly exhibit opposition towards George W. Bush\u2019s victory over Al Gore for the presidency.  According to Democratic Underground, as of June 2010, the website has almost 160,000 registered members and over 50,000,000 posts on their discussion boards in the last 9 years since their founding date in 2001.\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Activities\" id=\"Activities\"></a><h2> Activities </h2>\n<p>The vast amount of discussion boards are where most members associate themselves as participants with the website.  Members are able to start new discussion topics and reply to other messages made by other members.  Participants are also able to edit their own messages within one hour of the time they made their post.  However, messages cannot be deleted after the one hour timeframe, but members can alert the website moderators and ask for a post to be deleted.\n</p><p>The 160,000 members participate in over 34 topic forums found on the website which include specific discussions on topics such as civil liberties, the economy, education, election reform, environment/energy, the media, health, national security, and more.  Of the most popular forums, The DU Lounge, Latest Breaking News, and General Discussion are all discussion boards in which a range of topics can be discussed, rather than one specific subject matter.  Participants are able to create a page called \u201cMy Forums,\u201d which is a list if particular forums that are most interesting to them that they plan on visiting and participating in often.  Because the website is so large and has so many members and postings, the \u201cMy Forums\u201d option is a way to make Democratic Underground feel like a closer, more personal discussion forum.\n</p><p>\u201cDU Groups\u201d are another way for members to participate in deliberation.  A DU Groups is a special type of discussion forum which is committed to a specific mission or project.  The organization discusses these groups as \u201csafe haven\u201d discussion boards that require all group members who wish to be involved and post messages to agree to a mission statement for that particular cause.  These groups are not suggested by the administrators or moderators of the site, but the members themselves.  Through these groups, members are able to create smaller deliberation communities among the many members of the site.\n</p><p>The larger Democratic Underground community is also able to participate with each other by three popular pages: Lobby, Latest Page, and Greatest Page.  The Lobby is the reference page with a list of all available forums to join along with a list of moderators.  The Latest Page lists the most recent posts on the site, as well as a link the the Latest Breaking News forum for information.  And finally, the Greatest Page allows members to be interactive with each others postings.  On this page, threads are listed which have been nominated as \u201cnoteworthy\u201d by the site members.  Like the Greatest Page, threads can be recommended for the homepage as well which are chosen by the website administrators.  These pages are important to the organization because these serve as important reference pages for what the organization stands for.  These pages help visitors become informed about what forums are possible to join as well as what noteworthy posts have been made by fellow members.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Features\" id=\"Features\"></a><h2> Features </h2>\n<p>In order to make the discussion most beneficial and correlate to the mission and purpose of Democratic Underground, the boards are equipped with voluntary moderators. According to their website, the moderators are responsible for the following duties:\n</p>\n<ul><li>They answer questions from, and provide guidance to website visitors\n</li><li>They move, lock, or archive discussion threads for various reasons\n</li><li>They deal with copyright violations by website visitors\n</li><li>They delete disruptive and offensive posts\n</li><li>They shit off conservative disruptors\n</li><li>They alert administrators of any issues.\n</li></ul><p>These volunteers not only work for the betterment of the website, but act as participants in discussions as well.  They can participate in the general website discussions posted, and also have their own moderators-only discussion board to talk with each other about any problems or issues with the website.  When acting as a regular visitor or participant, the moderators are held at a higher standard when adding their input to discussion boards.  When taking on a participant role, moderators are to adhere to the following standards:\n</p>\n<ul><li>They are expected to behave themselves at all times in a way that reflects positively on Democratic Underground, and complies with all of the Rules and Regulations of the Website\n</li><li>They are expected to share and help promote Democratic Underground\u2019s mission of left-wing unity and solidarity \n</li><li>They may not engage in personal attacks against other members of the board\n</li><li>They may not engage in attacks against other political, social or minortiy groups such as the Democratic Party, the Green Party, the Democratic Leadership Council, environmentalists, union  members, gays and lesbians, Christians, etc. They are expected to avoid attacks against respected public figures in the Democratic Party or the political left.\n</li><li>They may not use their powers as a moderator to enforce a particular party line.  It is not appropriate for moderators to threaten to ban someone with whom they do not agree\n</li><li>They are expected to be fair and evenhanded at all times, especially to those with whom they disagree\n</li><li>They are forbidden from discussing moderator business anywhere except in the moderators-only discussion forum.  If it becomes apparent that a moderator has broken this rule, he/she will be relieved of moderator duties immediately, and may be banned from the discussion board as well.\n</li></ul><p>In order for the visitors and participants to insure that the moderators are acting accordingly, the website has an updated list of all current moderators, as well as their assignments, for visitors to be aware of.  If they should be aware of any posting, the participants can simply click the \u201calert\u201d button to alert a moderator.  The different criterion that the moderators must meet shows the degree to which the organization is attempting to make effective and successful discourse.  The organization makes this step in the deliberation process a priority for its members and visitors.\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2> Funding </h2>\n<p>Democratic Underground has four quarterly fundraisers each year.  Before the fundraisers begin, members can suggest certain charities that should also benefit from the money raised.  The last fundraiser for the 2009 year raised almost $1900 for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Parents, Family and Friends of Gays and Lesbians, Remote Area Medical Foundation, America\u2019s Vet Dogs, and Treehouse for Kids.  In this way, the fundraising process also includes a needed member deliberation.  Those who choose to donate are recognized on the website with a gold star.  The website also has a \u201cDonate\u201d link which members can donate to, and a Democratic Underground store as well which sells bumper stickers, shirts, coffee mugs, and bags.\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Secondary_Literature\" id=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a><h2> Secondary Literature </h2>\n<p>Pickard. \"Cooptation and Cooperation: Institutional Exemplars of Democratic Internet Technology.\" New Media &amp; Society 10.4 (2008): 625-45.

Smart education systems demonstrate a strong bond between the school district and other groups within the community. The Annenberg Institute bases their mission on four core principles that focus on the importance of seeing results, establishing equity among students, involving the community, and encouraging learning. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h1>History</h1><p>The Annenberg Institute for School Reform was founded in 1993 at Brown University. The initial establishment of the organization was made possible financially speaking through an anonymous donation to the university in the sum of $5 million. Later that year the Institute received an additional $50 million. This substantial gift came from Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg\u2019s Challenge to the Nation, a five-year, $500 million effort to improve American Public Education. The funding from Mr. Annenberg allowed the organization to dramatically broaden the extent of its work and it was therefore renamed in his honor. The Institute\u2019s first director, Dr. Theodore R. Sizer, worked to expand on the work he did previously as the founder and chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools, another organization at Brown University. With the Annenberg Institute, however, Sizer chose to take a much broader approach. He simply wanted to support valid efforts to improve the quality of education for young students across America. The retirement of Sizer in 1996 sparked a nation-wide search for a new director. In the fall of 1998, Dr. Warren Simmons was named executive director of the Institute and he has continued to hold the position to this day. Under Simmons, the AISR adopted a new mission statement, focusing on the need for improving education in the nation\u2019s more urban areas. In the year 2000, the Institute launched the Task Force on the Future of Urban Districts and opened an office in New York City. In 2001 the Institute\u2019s main headquarters were moved off of the university campus. And in 2003, the organization began publishing their own quarterly journal entitled Voices in Urban Education. Later, in 2005, the Institute worked with the Brown University\u2019s department of education to successfully establish a Master\u2019s Program in Urban Education Policy, a degree program that focuses on many of the issues important to their organization. The Annenberg Institute\u2019s programs and staff continued to grow over the next couple years and in 2007, it opened a larger office in New York City. <a id=\"Major_Projects\" name=\"Major_Projects\"></a></p><h1>Major Projects</h1><p>Organized Communities, Stronger Schools: The Impact of Community and Your Organizing on Public School Reform \u2013 For this project, the Institute conducted a six-year study to analyze how community organizing for school reform affects the educational results in the community. The study examined the organization efforts of the residents in seven different urban communities. They then measured the impact of their efforts based on three criteria: district=level policy, school-level capacity, and student outcomes. In each of the seven case studies, the schools experienced positive results. In Austin, the groups education organizing resulted in new parent and school leadership, more funding, and even improved relationships between community members. The study conducted in eastern Pennsylvania showed that community organizing earned parents more access to school information and even caused a slight rise in high school attendance.</p><p>The Rhode Island Urban Education Task Force (UETF), one of the Institute\u2019s more recent projects, began in 2008 when the governor of Rhode Island Donald Carcieri asked director Warren Simmons specifically to lead a task force to develop ways to enhance education in the state. The force included community members as well as governmental and civic leaders. It was focused principally in the five most urban schools including Newport, Providence, Woonsocket, Pawtucket, and Central Falls. In order to accomplish their goal, the UETF held countless forums to allow participation form the public to develop a broad range of solutions for the problem at hand. After considering these solutions and evaluating their potential for success, the group made recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly. After the submission of a final report in October of 2009, the members of the state\u2019s government began the process of implementing a some of the recommendations made by the task force.</p><p>The Emerging Knowledge Forum is a highly notable project that was developed in 2004 and continues to take place to this day. Every year, the Annenberg Institute holds a forum that lasts two days and involves approximately 125 participants. The goal of the forum is to bring together a group of people to offer diverse thinking on how to improve the education system. The extensive group discussions allow the participants to lean about the different approaches to creating new, more beneficial system of learning. The idea is that people will leave the forum, wanting to share their newly acquired knowledge with other members of their social network. This will help to create community support for the new ideas.</p><p>Voices in Urban Education, the Annenberg Institute\u2019s quarterly journal, was developed in 2003 and is truly and ongoing project for the organization. Each issue presents diverse viewpoints surrounding the debate on how to improve education in urban areas. By presenting a wide array of solutions and approaches, the journal challenges readers to draw their own conclusions. The Institute views the journal as \u201ca roundtable to air diverse viewpoints and share knowledge on vital issues in urban education.\u201d <a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h1>Funding</h1><p>The Annenberg Institute receives funding form a wide array of sources in order to pursue many of its major projects.

In addition to this, Democracy international seeks to fight for a better democracy on a nation wide level and no longer limit direct democracy to communities, regions, and states.</p><p>The mission of Democracy International is, \u201cour constitution\u2026 is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the greatest number.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Envisioning that direct democracy on the EU level could enable citizens to actively participate in European politics, lead to more informed and engaged citizenship, and reflect the will of the citizens to build a common future.</p><p>Democracy International proposes to build initiatives that serve their mission statement and although many of their network partners want them to become a membership organization they refuse because membership organizations already exist in many nations. With a cooperation team made up of 6 members, Democracy International holds yearly conferences and has an office that is established in Brussels Belgium.</p><p>Democracy International has very successfully conducted campaigns to obtain referendums on the European Constitution and in 10 EU member states these referendums have been announced. Although efforts for a European constitution were not successful their efforts did not go unnoticed and the European Citizens initiative was included and Democracy International was one of the many organizations to help with the campaign. Currently, Europe does not have an organization that focuses solely on direct democracy in the EU and this is what Democracy International is striving to accomplish. Creating a network that enables citizens to influence the political decision-making process, Democracy International aims at raising the question of who is in power.</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Democracy international, an organization originally stemmed from a group called more democracy, was founded in 1998. More democracy originally established a group of working people which dealt with European and global issues. This organization\u2019s job was to then come up with a proposal that would introduce ways to assimilate elements of direct democracy into the already established European Union treaties. The proposal was presented in 2001.</p><p>Democracy international not only did this, but they also came up with the NDDIE, the Network of Direct Democracy Initiatives in Europe. The NDDIE coordinated and planned three separate conventions. The three conventions were held in Munich in 2000, Prague in 2001, and Bratislava in 2002. The goal of these conventions was to get all the dedicated members together and give them a place where they could talk about their ideas. These three conventions served as a place where they could be around people who believed in spreading direct democracy.</p><p>Democracy international came up with a split approach the night before the convention. They not only came up with the European Referendum Campaign, but at the same time, they pressed for the addition of the initiatives and referendum in the last text of the convention.</p><p>Both approaches did well in their own ways. Not only did the nine participating states agree to get rid of the European constitution with the referendum, but the conventions also led to a European citizens initiative that allowed one million members from the states with members to take governmental action.</p><p><a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p><a id=\"Network_for_Direct_Democracy_in_Europe_.28NDDIE.29\" name=\"Network_for_Direct_Democracy_in_Europe_.28NDDIE.29\"></a></p><h3>Network for Direct Democracy in Europe (NDDIE)</h3><p>During the weekend of November 13 2000, in Munich Germany, the first conference of the network for Direct Democracy in Europe was held. With a rising concern for the democratic deficit in Europe the NDDIE main goal is to support the European direct democracy. Direct democracy groups have spread throughout every country in Europe and over 60 activist groups from 19 different countries were present.</p><p>The conference discussed an array of topics but mainly focused on the way in which a direct democracy could function in the European Union. With the progression of discussion many of the activist groups agreed to brainstorm and work on proposals, which would potentially be discussed at the next conference. The establishment of a conference created excitement within the political activist community because now there was a platform for them to congregate and discuss news and information.</p><p>Overall, the NDDIE is determined to reinforce and establish a direct democracy in every country throughout Europe and will not stop until they have achieved that goal.</p><p><a id=\"European_Referendum_Campaign\" name=\"European_Referendum_Campaign\"></a></p><h3>European Referendum Campaign</h3><p>The European Referendum Campaign is an independent, European, cross party network with the objective of bringing together individuals and NGOs to fight for democratic development within the European Union. The legal definition of a referendum is \u201cthe submission to popular vote of a measure passed on or proposed by a legislative body or by popular initiative.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a> So the sole objective of the European Referendum Campaign is to gain as many referendums on the new EU Lisbon Treaty in as many EU member states as possible. With the support of 293 organizations the European Referendum Campaign has successfully organized 9 international events and gatherings, which have focused on founding a more direct democracy in the European Union.</p><p><a id=\"_Launch_of_the_campaign\" name=\"_Launch_of_the_campaign\"></a></p><h4>November 2002: Launch of the campaign</h4><p>The purpose of this event was for people to come together and swap ideas about the European Referendum Campaign. 80 people attended this event, from 22 different countries. The first night was spent with the guests getting to know each other, and the next days discussing ways on how to apply direct democracy into the European Union Constitution. There were different workshops to choose from, and intelligent guest speakers to listen to. The whole goal of this event was to get people informed and excited about the upcoming campaign.</p><p><a id=\"_Display_in_Brussels\" name=\"_Display_in_Brussels\"></a></p><h4>June 2003: Display in Brussels</h4><p>40 advocates, coming from 5 different countries came together in Brussels, Belgium on the day of Friday the 13th to celebrate democracy international\u2019s second success. This was the final gathering of the conference and on this day they signed 97 members from the convention.</p><p><a id=\"_European_social_forum_in_Paris\" name=\"_European_social_forum_in_Paris\"></a></p><h4>November 2003: European social forum in Paris</h4><p>The main goal of this event was to help spread awareness for the ERC by holding two workshops. 20 supporters, who came from six different countries worked at this event. Democracy International wanted to give people who wanted to get involved with spreading democracy throughout the European Union a place to go. The ideas of these workshops were well intended, but not many people actually attended the workshops.</p><p><a id=\"_Europe_wide_Day_of_Action\" name=\"_Europe_wide_Day_of_Action\"></a></p><h4>December 2003: Europe wide Day of Action</h4><p>On this day activists from different countries did what they could to spread the word and support for the European Union Referendum. To gain support, the ERC came up with an event that happened on the same day in over 20 European countries. The countries all individual helped to create unique events to captivate the attention of the people.</p><p><a id=\"_In_front_of_the_summit_in_Brussels\" name=\"_In_front_of_the_summit_in_Brussels\"></a></p><h4>December 2003: In front of the summit in Brussels</h4><p>This event involved a seven-meter high inflatable display. The inflatable display signifies the European Unions constitution, and its point was to get the attention of the public and the media. The mayor approved of this display and allowed the activists to put it in front of where the Intergovernmental conference took place.</p><p><a id=\"_Citizens.E2.80.99_summit_in_Berlin\" name=\"_Citizens.E2.80.99_summit_in_Berlin\"></a></p><h4>February 2004: Citizens\u2019 summit in Berlin</h4><p>People came from all over Europe to attend this event, in order to gain the attention from the European leaders. The people met because they felt they needed to insist on a referendum on the European Constitution. In order to be heard they felt the need to be close to where the leaders were holding their get together.</p><p><a id=\"_On_the_Road_in_the_UK\" name=\"_On_the_Road_in_the_UK\"></a></p><h4>March 2004: On the Road in the UK</h4><p>The purpose of this event was to spread awareness of direct democracy to local legislative bodies. In order to do this, democracy international had their campaign bus drive throughout all of England informing people of the issue.</p><p><a id=\"_Parties_confession_survey\" name=\"_Parties_confession_survey\"></a></p><h4>June 2004: Parties confession survey</h4><p>The confession campaign was a convention where people would participate and take a survey from the European Referendum Campaign. \u201cOnly about 30% of more than 250 parties asked committed themselves to be in favour of a referendum. In contrast to that 84% of the EU citizens are in favour of a referendum.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a> This event allowed them to see how people would vote on this issue, and actual numbers.</p><p><a id=\"_Around_the_Baltic_Sea\" name=\"_Around_the_Baltic_Sea\"></a></p><h4>September 2004: Around the Baltic Sea</h4><p>This event was based off the idea that the referendum on the new European constitutional treaty was all about receiving acceptance from other countries. The idea was to travel and spread the word to countries that did not know anything about this issue.</p><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p><a id=\"General_Funding\" name=\"General_Funding\"></a></p><h3>General Funding</h3><p>Democracy International receives its funding by donations from individuals and <a href=\"/wiki/Mehr_Demokratie\" title=\"Mehr Demokratie\">Mehr_Demokratie</a> (More Democracy). Democracy International has no intention of making the organization financially dependent on other organizations, corporations, individuals or official institutions and will maintain it\u2019s autonomy at all times.</p><p>Currently, all donations made to Democracy International will go towards campaigning for a fair regulation of the European Citizen\u2019s Initiative. Individuals are encouraged to email Democracy International, call Ronald Pabst in Cologne (++ 49 2203 59 28 59) or make a direct wire transfer from a personal back account.</p><p>To help fund its efforts Democracy International currently has a close legal and personal relationship to Mehr Demokratie a non-profit organization in Germany. This allows Democracy International to not be considered a formal organization and avoid the more controlled bureaucratic and administrative effort that being a formal organization entails. Also since Mehr Demokratie is a registered non-profit organization it enables any individual who donates to Democracy International to receive a tax reduction if you are resident of Germany.</p><p><a id=\"Major_Projects\" name=\"Major_Projects\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects</h2><p><a id=\"European_Citizens.E2.80.99_Initiative\" name=\"European_Citizens.E2.80.99_Initiative\"></a></p><h3>European Citizens\u2019 Initiative</h3><p>Democracy International was responsible for aiding in the efforts to ensure that the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative was included in the draft of the European Union Constitution and also in the Lisbon Treaty.</p><p>Michael Efler, one of the cooperation team members for Democracy International published a study that examines the legal possibilities for implementing the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative. Further explaining that the European Union has often times been criticized for is democratic deficit and the overall lack of citizen participation and direct democracy. It is from this that the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative stems.</p><p>The European Citizens\u2019 Initiative is one of the major innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon. The initiative enables one million European Union citizens to call directly on the European Commissions to bring forward an initiative of interest to them in an area of EU competence. This is the first time that citizens will have a direct say in EU affairs and allows for more participatory democracy. This new approach would allow citizens to help shape the future of the European Union and potentially assist in the decision making process.</p><p><a id=\"New_Convention\" name=\"New_Convention\"></a></p><h3>New Convention</h3><p>Democracy International purposes to create a new convention that is a truly democratic. Although such a convention would be difficult to achieve, Democracy International would propose a treaty that would gain citizen support. The new convention would be based upon the following principles: <a href=\"#cite_note-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a></p><ul><li>The direct election of convention members</li><li>A democratic convention procedure</li><li>Continual citizen participation</li><li>The outcome of the convention shall be open in its results</li><li>Referendums on the outcome of the convention</li></ul><p><a id=\"_Brussels_2010\" name=\"_Brussels_2010\"></a></p><h3>Democracy International Conference: Brussels 2010</h3><p>In November 2010, Democracy International held a conference in Brussels to relaunch the organization and redevelop a strong tie between the people and the initiatives.

An association for direct democracy via Internet. Demoex makes it possible to be active in the local governments debates for anyone, but only members have the rights to vote and thereby influence our seat.</p><p>Demoex concept is to mix direct- and representative democracy. Our \u201cagora\u201d is the Internet site.</p><p>How does it work? When Demoex get the summons to a new meeting they open debates and referendums in all \"voteable\" issues. These issues are then debated before the members finally send their ballots the day before the meeting. The representatives in the local government votes to statistically represent the result from the internet referendums.</p><p>History Demoex started off as a grass-root initiative. It all begun at Vallentuna upper secondary school October 3rd 2000, when the municipality organized a theme day on \u201cIT and democracy\u201d and the question why so few young persons are politically active emerged.</p><p>Some students answered that they did not approve to choosing between ideologies. They expressed that their point of views were impossible to place on a political right-left scale. Other students were pessimistic about the aspects of political influence. \u201cDecisions are made from above\u201d they argued. Others answered they had no time to involve in politics. Others again thought of politics boring, tiring and insignificant.</p><p>After an internet debate an oral discussion with local politicians followed. The evaluation showed that students appreciated the speed and the structure offered by the electronic debate-system but they felt run over by the traditional oral debate.</p><p>From this experience a handful of students discussed with their philosophy teacher possibilities of developing democracy. That was how the Demoex idea was born. They decided to register a party and candidate for the local government in September 2002 with only one promise: Direct Democracy.</p><p>In January 2002 Demoex started to work on the project. Soon after they contacted Mikael Nordfors, a pioneer within e-democracy in Sweden. Already in the early 1990\u2019s Mikael founded a party with a similar ideology.

ZCom is about race, gender, power, class, ecology, and peace - it is about justice in all conceivable forms -- seeing each as intimately entwined with and certainly in no sense prior to or alone causal of the rest.</p><p>A second notable aspect is a commitment to fundamental transformation and two implications that stem from that commitment. First, ZCom highlights that successful action in the present depends very much not only on understanding current conditions but also on broad clarity about future goals and building links between the two. A priority of ZCom is therefore vision and strategy regarding all sides of life. Second, however, ZCom is convinced that a movement able to transform society requires massive, highly informed, participatory, unwavering allegiance which will only grow and persist if the seeds of a better future are embodied in the actions of current activists.</p><p>When South End Press was born in the late 1970s, and when Z Magazine spun off ten years later, and in all the innovations since then leading to ZNet, ZVideo, and ZMI, and now to ZCom and its new ZSpace, there has been continuity.</p><p>Our mission is to help improve life via social struggle that builds growing commitment and organization informed by understanding existing conditions and shared vision of future improvement, fueled by personal and structural solidarity, by personal and collective desire, and by personal and rational hope.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>South End Press (1978) was founded to raise consciousness about class, gender, race, and power and to provide information, analysis, and vision to help activism. Z Magazine (1987) aimed to bring more diverse information more often and to increase the visibility of writers and illustrators. In ZCom, we added ZNet and ZTranslations, ZMI, ZVideo, and most recently ZEO and ZSpace including ZBlogs and ZForums.</p><p>Z Magazine was founded by Michael Albert and Lydia Sargent. Lydia in turn initiated ZVideo and works overwhelmingly on ZMag and ZVideo. Michael initiated ZNet and works overwhelmingly on web operations. Eric Sargent joined in the late 1980s and works on Z Magazine and ZVideo. Andy Dunn (ZMI 2000) joined in 2005 and works on Z Magazine and ZVideo. Chris Spannos (ZMI 2001) joined in 2006, working on ZNet. Everyone works on ZMI.</p><p>ZCom also gets volunteer help. Brian Dominick (ZMI 1999) helped design and program ZNet. Justin Podur and Stephen Shalom have assisted editorially for years. Other volunteers work on some watch pages and especially and with great devotion and energy on Z Translations.</p><p>The online operations have been through many incarnations. Originally Left Bulletin Board System (PBBS), they morphed into Left On Line, ZNet, and finally ZCom. Even ZCom has itself had lifetimes, already - two major makeovers, among other changes brought us to the current situation in which now, to ZNet, ZMag, ZVideo, and and ZMI, we add ZSpace.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Alternative_to_Corporate_Media\" name=\"Alternative_to_Corporate_Media\"></a></p><h2>Alternative to Corporate Media</h2><p>Z receives zero financial support from corporate sponsors.

Among the observers was the President of the Initiative and Referendum Institute \u2013 Europe, Mr. Bruno Kaufmann, also a member of the IRI-Asia ISC. After observing a total of 60 polling stations in Taipei City, Taipei County, and Kaohsiung City, the observation team issued a statement regarding the referendums, which can be downloaded from the IRI-Asia website. The TFD also invited an observation team from the Asian Network for Free Election to observe the presidential election.</p><p>b) The Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute \u2013 Asia is committed to democratizing democracy so that people can participate directly in policy-making and take greater responsibility in governance.</p><p>To achieve this objective, IRI-Asia is currently:</p><p>(1)Advancing understanding of and commitment to the realization of direct democracy in Asia</p><p>(2) Promoting best practices and legislation of initiatives and referendums as a complement to representative forms of government in Asia</p><p>(3) Observing and reviewing the initiatives and referendums held in respective Asian countries</p><p>(4) Researching and publishing on issues regarding initiatives and referendums so as to improve the instruments of direct democracy</p><p>(5) Undertaking education activities related to direct democracy</p><p>(6) Cooperating with other organizations with similar purposes in promoting direct democracy around the world</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Back in 2003, the long standing public demand for a referendum law in Taiwan gradually led to legislation. President Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party had made many campaign pledges in the year 2000 presidential election for such a law, promising that the right of citizens to initiatives and referendums that is already included in Taiwan\u2019s constitution would be substantiated in Law by a DPP government. A law was finally passed on November 27, 2003, just a few months before the March 2004 presidential election.</p><p>Key experts and the founders of IRI-Europe and USA were the invited guest speakers in this project. The fundamental objective of the TFD was to give access to as many people as possible to independent expert opinion on direct democracy. As a result of this interaction in Taiwan between the TFD and the IRI-Europe and USA, the idea of establishing a sister IRI organization in Taiwan in order to help it implement direct democracy was borne. The objectives of IRI-Asia were set as the same as IRI-Europe and USA, which is to promote and advocate direct democracy in the world, provide education on its mechanisms to all interested parties, gather the talents of experts and scholars to improve the referendum and initiative instruments, and to help monitor their use in Asian countries.</p><p>The goal was thus set to make IRI-Asia the premier institution on direct democracy in the region, helping improve the instruments of direct democracy in Asia where they already exists (over 30 countries) or assist in implementing them where they do not.</p><p><a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>a) Project Civil Referendum 2007 Observation Mission (Hong Kong)</p><p>b) Direct Democracy in Local Politics in European Countries</p><p>c) Marburg Colloquy on Direct Democracy in Europe</p><p>d) International Steering Committee Meeting Agenda</p><p>e) IRI-Europe Event: Capacity Building Seminar on the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative</p><p>f) International Conference on Direct Democracy in Latin America</p><p>g) International Conference on Deliberative Democrac</p><p>- Scholars and practitioners of deliberative and direct democracy from Europe, the US, Japan, and Korea gathered in Taipei to exchange experiences of practicing deliberative democracy in different cultural settings and political contexts.</p><p>h) The Realization of E-Deliberation: An experiment of \u201cOnline Citizen Conference\u201d</p><p>- This experiment was a pioneer in effectively employing information and communication technology to facilitate face-to-face deliberation</p><p>i) Direct Democracy Study Trip in Europe</p><p>- The TFD then began to form a core group of 10 Taiwanese scholars and democracy advocates who undertook the TFD\u2019s IRI-Asia project. The group was formed in the summer of 2004, and after a few meetings, first went on a European study tour that took them to 5 countries in 6 days in Sept-Oct. 2004. They discussed all aspects of direct democracy with European counterparts from old and new democracies, and also witnessed a national referendum in Switzerland.</p><p>j) International Symposium on Referendums, Initiatives, and Direct Democracy</p><p>- The members of the group had by then met a few times to draw the rough outlines of what IRI-Asia could be and do based on extensive discussion with direct democracy experts.

They have not been maintaining their website and were last updated August 3rd, 2009. However, The IRI-Asia website does provide other important sources for the project they are working on with other organizations such as Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, World Forum for Democratization in Asia, and Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute of Europe.</p><p>With their mission of democratizing democracy so that people can participate directly in policy-making and take greater responsibility in governance, the IRI-Asia have done a great job prioritizing themselves by advancing their understanding of the direct democracy in Asia, promoting best practices and legislation of initiatives and referendums, observing and reviewing the initiatives and referendums held in respective Asian countries. The IRI-Asia has also been researching and publishing issues regarding initiatives and referendums so as to improve the instrument of direct democracy. They also have been undertaking education activities related to direct democracy and cooperating with other organizations with similar purposes in promoting direct democracy around the world.</p><p>The IRI-Asia has been participating in IRI from all over the world to learn about these best practices and using the things they learn at International Conferences on Direct Democracy in Latin America and International Conference on Deliberative Democracy. With attending conventions that talks about deliberation in a democracy, they were able to learn their problems and can identify a broad range of solutions.</p><p>IRI-Asia is an organization that mostly only sought out information and advice from expert on democracy deliberation. This makes weighing the pros, cons, and trade-offs of any ideas that are brought up by the people of Asia.</p><p>b) Social Process:</p><p>Some of the events that the IRI-Asia hosts do not provide a space for public engagement and discussion. For example, it hosted a team of six international observers from the IRI-Asia International Steering Committee (ISC) representing six countries in Asia and Europe from 19-24 March 2008 in Taipei to observe two national-level referendums. The observing teams focuses on researching and publishing on issues regarding initiatives and referendums so as to improve the instruments of direct democracy, but the project it is not open to the general public. Therefore, speaking opportunities are limited to those in the committees.</p><p>In 2004, IRI-Asia sponsored four community-level consensus conferences, which culminated in a joint press conference in which citizens had the chance to conduct face-to-face dialogue with high-level government officials. The event provides a space for public engagement and discussion; however, there is no information about the discussion within the committees, so it is hard to evaluate whether or not people in the committees have mutual comprehension, respect for other participants, and whether they consider others\u2019 ideas and experiences.</p><p><a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><p>a) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.iri-asia.net/?mod=About&amp;node_id=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.iri-asia.net/?mod=About&amp;node_id=8\">http://www.iri-asia.net/?mod=About&amp;node_id=8</a> - IRI-Asia Official Website</p><p>b) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.iri-asia.net/files/3.1.2.1Deepening%20Democratic%20Governance.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.iri-asia.net/files/3.1.2.1Deepening%20Democratic%20Governance.pdf\">http://www.iri-asia.net/files/3.1.2.1Deepening%20Democratic%20Governance.pdf</a> - Deepening Democratic Governance by Marrying Direct (Scholarly source)</p><p>b) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.iri-europe.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.iri-europe.org/\">http://www.iri-europe.org/</a> - IRI-Europe Official Website</p><p>IRI Europe is a non-partisan, non-profit-making association with headquarters in Marburg/Germany and brings together some of the best experts on and practitioners of the initiative and referendum process across Europe and the world.

It is also a NGO established in Buenos Aires in the year 2009. We are currently developing the first web application for Eudemocratic governance in small communities.</p><h2>Goals</h2><p>Provide and foster efficient ways in which communities can enhance their involvement in governance. Our proposal takes into account everyone's skills and experience. As involvement aids the development of collaborative capabilities, it will also help pinpointing common priorities and avoid bureaucracy and corruption therefore leading to successful accomplishment of initiatives.</p><p>Developing such a tool for a Country is a complex matter. Hence, we started out with a simplified version of the issue: communities with up to 5000 members, with a certain structure and education level of its users in order to run the system. We've initially aimed at Universities; however NGOs, clubs and other neighbourhood organizations may fulfil the above requirements. <a id=\"Mission\" name=\"Mission\"></a></p><h2>Mission</h2><p>Develop a Direct Democracy system through Internet; being implemented by small wired communities. We believe Web 2.0 has created the perfect environment where to nurse and nourish an Open, Direct Democracy, capable of finding its own place inside the current Representative system or even replacing it!</p><p>Without any kind of proscription on other Political Parties, all issues and proposals will flow through the system. It is truly an inclusive tool by nature, doesn't clash with any ideology or group. Furthermore, those who disagree with our proposal will be able to continue voting for representatives as they have been doing in the past without loosing their right to use the application as the rest of the community. <a id=\"Vision\" name=\"Vision\"></a></p><h2>Vision</h2><p>We hope to prove that the only obstacle to achieving an Eudemocratic Government is the free and universal internet access for the whole society. Finally grounding the already proposed idea that the new illiterate is the one who lacks internet access.</p><p>This way, the current representative democracy (which is nothing but false or pseudo democracy) will finally fall to pieces, leading to the rise of a true democracy, never seen before since the times of Ancient Greece. <a id=\"Values\" name=\"Values\"></a></p><h2>Values</h2><p>1.

Statt wirkungslosen Volksbegehren fordern wir faire Volksabstimmungen!</p><p>Unser prim\u00e4res Anliegen ist die Koppelung des Volksbegehrens an die Volksabstimmung. Diese Koppelung gibt der Bev\u00f6lkerung die M\u00f6glichkeit, Volksabstimmungen selbst einleiten zu k\u00f6nnen. Dadurch wird gew\u00e4hrleistet, dass wir Menschen in den Entwicklungsprozess und in die Fragestellung einer Volksabstimmung mit eingebunden sind.

Daher kann in diesem Fall nicht davon gesprochen werden, dass das Recht vom Volk ausgeht. Die B\u00fcrgerInnen w\u00e4hlen zwar alle vier (zuk\u00fcnftig f\u00fcnf) Jahre die Abgeordneten zum Nationalrat, haben aber anschlie\u00dfend keinerlei M\u00f6glichkeit selbst Abstimmungen zu initiieren.

Eso es la Democracia.\n</p><p>\nEl Partido de Internet quiere hacer de la Democracia algo real y tangible para la ciudadan\u00eda pues son los ciudadanos los que hacen funcionar la sociedad, los que la hacen crecer y evolucionar. Por eso en el PdI creemos firmemente que para evolucionar hay que involucrarse en el proceso. Si la ciudadan\u00eda se comporta como un mero espectador nunca podr\u00e1 dirigir el proceso hacia donde su voluntad la gu\u00ede, pero si se involucra activamente podr\u00e1 encauzar las decisiones, iniciativas y medidas en la direcci\u00f3n que su voluntad leg\u00edtima haya determinado.\n</p><p>La iniciativa del Partido de Internet posibilita que la voz de la ciudadan\u00eda se escuche dentro del Congreso. He aqu\u00ed en este punto lo realmente innovador, pues haremos saber en todo momento, con n\u00famero exacto y en tiempo real lo que opina la ciudadan\u00eda. Ello se conseguir\u00e1 creando un entorno virtual (web) de votaci\u00f3n continua, de discusi\u00f3n y acuerdo dentro del propio partido que desembocar\u00e1 en una opini\u00f3n mayoritaria que guiar\u00e1 la decisi\u00f3n final de el/la diputado en relaci\u00f3n a todas las votaciones que se lleven a cabo.\n</p><p>\nTodo ciudadano puede entrar en la web del partido y expresar su opini\u00f3n y conmutar su voto en cada votaci\u00f3n del Congreso sin que para ello se haya tenido que afiliar al partido. Esto obedece a la propia identidad del partido: Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana sin cortapisas de ning\u00fan tipo.\n</p><p>\nTodos tenemos en mente la burocracia que impera en las diferentes instancias del estado, las numerosas leyes que se votan todos los d\u00edas y de las cuales la ciudadan\u00eda en general normalmente no tiene conocimiento. Es por ello que en el seno del partido se han creado comisiones de informaci\u00f3n que clasificar\u00e1n las votaciones en virtud de las diferentes materias que afecten la vida diaria del Estado. Acorde a esas clasificaciones se posibilitar\u00e1 la creaci\u00f3n de diferentes grupos o corrientes de opini\u00f3n dentro del entorno virtual para que todas las tendencias que conforman el abanico ideol\u00f3gico de la sociedad se vean reflejadas de facto en el seno del partido. Esos grupos ser\u00e1n los que inclinen la balanza en una direcci\u00f3n u otra a la hora de que nuestros diputados voten en el Congreso.\n</p><p>Los grupos se conformar\u00e1n con una estructura id\u00e9ntica para todos, formada por plantillas base que cada afiliado podr\u00e1 personalizar acorde a sus inquietudes pol\u00edticas. Esto posibilitar\u00e1 que cualquier votante pueda delegar su voto en un grupo o de manera independiente dependiendo del deseo del mismo.\n</p><p>Ser un afiliado del Partido de Internet es de por s\u00ed una identidad democr\u00e1tica. Un ciudadano que vota al PdI est\u00e1 implic\u00e1ndose con determinaci\u00f3n en el proceso democr\u00e1tico. Se implica porque quiere cambiar las cosas. Se implica porque cree firmemente en que la pol\u00edtca ha de ser parte de la ciudadan\u00eda y por tanto la voz de esta ha de ser escuchada en el Parlamento. Un afiliado tiene una responsabilidad para con los dem\u00e1s afiliados y por extensi\u00f3n para con el resto de la sociedad. Un afiliado forma parte activa de la vida diaria del partido, proponiendo contenidos e interviniendo en los debates, pero puede implicarse a\u00fan m\u00e1s cooperando con los dem\u00e1s afiliados y la organizaci\u00f3n del partido en cada una de las tareas para las cuales se vea preparado.

The organization believes the full development of policy options requires the development and consideration of meaningful citizen input. Accordingly, the mission of the Interactivity Foundation \u201c\u2026is to enhance the process and expand the scope of our public discussions, thereby improving the health of our democracy and its development of public policy. That is, IF works to improve both the quality and quantity of the public discussions that shape the development of our public policy options.\u201d</p><p>The Foundation works publicly and continually and \u201clearns by doing\u201d.

The Interactivity Foundation is a non-partisan, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization. The IF does not engage in political advocacy for itself or any other organization or group. The organization does not provide grants to other groups, but occasionally engages in joint research. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>The Interactivity Foundation was founded and incorporated in 1965, under Delaware law, by West-Virginian businessman Jay Stern. The Interactivity Foundation was originally founded as the \u201cUpper Ohio Valley Self Help Foundation\u201d. Its name was changed to the current title in 1987. The Foundation conducted seven projects in the United States in the 1990s. In 2001, the IF hired several Fellows to further develop its processes and engage in more Projects. Jay Stern continues to provide significant contributions to The Foundation.</p><p>In 2002, the first series of Project Discussions began. Since then, the IF has continued to engage in Project Discussions. The conclusions of Project Discussions, when possible, have been used to create \u201cDiscussion Reports\u201d.</p><p>Following the development of the Project Discussion process, the IF began working on ways to facilitate student-centered discussions in college classrooms. Development began in 2005, and the collegiate discussion process, Classroom Discussion, led to the creation of a Summer conference program named the Summer Institute. In the program, the IF works with college professors to adapt their discussion process to the classroom environment. The Summer Institute program was held in 2006 and in 2009. The programs had a lasting impact on the colleges where they were held: several college campuses now have sponsored courses, which facilitate the Interactivity Foundation's form of deliberative discussion.</p><p>Seeking more open and public projects, IF Fellows began testing the The Foundation's Discussion Reports in shorter discussion series in 2007. These discussions are now called Public Discussions. These projects have been \u201cvery helpful\u201d in further developing the Discussion Reports used by the IF. Significantly, the Interactivity Foundation believes that Public Discussions are central to their mission. <a id=\"Structure\" name=\"Structure\"></a></p><h2>Structure</h2><p>The Interactivity Foundation is governed by a Board of Trustees. The Board serves three, primary functions. First, the Board administers the financial matters of the IF. The Board also administers the Foundation\u2019s general mission. Finally, the Board controls an Intellectual Development Committee, which handles the operational and day-to-day concerns of the organization. The Board of Trustees has central control over all of the organization\u2019s decisions. While the main office and its staff are located in Parkersburg, West Virginia, the President of the IF, other members of the Intellectual Development Committee, and the Fellows reside in other locations throughout the United States. Most of the organization\u2019s work is done in locations separate from its main office. <a id=\"Methods_of_Deliberation\" name=\"Methods_of_Deliberation\"></a></p><h2>Methods of Deliberation</h2><p>Project Discussions</p><p>Project discussions focus on broad, complex topics of societal concern. Fellows facilitate discussions that focus on a variety of issues, such as the future of K-12 education, civil rights, food policy and property rights. Two panels of 5-8 citizens are recruited to participate in discussions about a specific area of public interest over an extended period of time. One panel includes persons with some form of expertise on the subject, known as \u201cspecialists\u201d. The other panel consists of non-experts with an interest in discussing the topic, called \u201cgeneralists.\u201d The panels work independently for most of the project. At the end of the project, which can last over one year, the two panels meet to discuss and combine ideas while helping a fellow prepare a Discussion Report.</p><p>While the discussions are generally organic and non-linear, they are designed and facilitated to progress through several stages: \u201c(1) exploring the emerging concerns about the topic that society might face; (2) developing multiple and different possible responses to those concerns; (3) exploring the possible consequences for each of those different approaches; which leads to (4) revision and often consolidation of the possibilities.\u201d The process used is designed, specifically, to protect panelists from external and internal pressures. Social approval, time, and conventional wisdom are among the pressures prevented. Because Project Discussions provide for intellectual safety and comfort, the IF sometimes calls them \u201cSanctuary Discussions\u201d. The combination of these stages and procedures forms a deliberative process created internally by the Interactivity Foundation for their own research and activities.</p><p>Classroom Discussions</p><p>The Interactivity Foundation also applies its discussion process to the classroom. Key similarities between the college environment and IF\u2019s approach to public discussion include a long-term time framework without a demand for short-term payoffs, a focus on exploration for its own sake, a value in discourse and dialogue, and increased civic engagement. In 2006 and 2009, the Interactivity Foundation hosted and sponsored \u201cSummer Institutes\u201d. The IF selected and worked with interested college professors with mutual interests in the development of public discussion. These conferences have led the Interactivity Foundation to support a variety of college courses containing substantial elements of the organization\u2019s discussion process. The Foundation continues to work with many professors for research and other projects.</p><p>Public Discussions</p><p>The starting points of public discussions (sometimes called citizen discussions) are policy reports generated by IF. Much like the longer-time project discussions, an active facilitator leads a discussion of 5-8 participants. However, public discussions only last 1-3 sessions. The goal of public discussions is to engage with the policy possibilities generated by the \"sanctuary\" panel and spread the deliberative process. IF sponsors the discussions in order to enrich public conversation and strengthen our democracy. <a id=\"Current_Activities\" name=\"Current_Activities\"></a></p><h2>Current Activities</h2><p>The Interactivity Foundation is continually researching and developing its discussion process. Accordingly, IF sponsors and hosts both Project Discussions and Public Discussions. IF is planning its next Summer Institute, which will take place in 2012.</p><p>The following is a list of current long-term Project Discussions:</p><p>Future of Childhood</p><p>Shaping our Towns &amp; Cities,</p><p>Human Migration</p><p>Money,\u00a0Credit and Debt</p><p>The Future of the Arts &amp; Society</p><p>Sports &amp; Society</p><p>The Future of the Family</p><p>The Future of Higher Education,</p><p>Crime &amp; Punishment</p><p>Democratic Practice &amp; Process</p><p>The following is a list of possible topics for current Public Discussions:</p><p>Food: What Might Be for Dinner?</p><p>Helping Out: Humanitarian Policy for Global Security,</p><p>Democratic Nation Building</p><p>The Future of K-12 Education</p><p>Global Security</p><p>Health Care: the Case of Depression,</p><p>Privacy &amp; Privacy Rights</p><p>Anticipating Human Genetic Technology</p><p>Science</p><p>Rewarding Work</p><p>Property &amp; Property Rights</p><p>The Future of Regulation</p><p>Helping America Talk</p><p>How Will We All Retire?</p><p>The Future of Civil Rights <a id=\"Publications\" name=\"Publications\"></a></p><h2>Publications</h2><p>Note: See the External Links section on the bottom of this page for more information.</p><p>The following Discussion Reports are complete and publicly available:</p><p>Health Care: the Case of Depression,</p><p>Privacy &amp; Privacy Rights,</p><p>Anticipating Human Genetic Technology,</p><p>Science,</p><p>Rewarding Work,</p><p>Property,</p><p>The Future of Regulation,</p><p>Helping America Talk,</p><p>How Will We All Retire?</p><p>The following Guidebooks, which provide practical advice for having a facilitated discussion, have been published and are publicly available:</p><p>Facilitation Guidebook (1st edition, 2005)\u2014a guide for facilitating Project Discussions,</p><p>Support Materials for the IF Discussion Process (1st edition, 2009)\u2014a guide for participants in a Project Discussion,</p><p>Facilitation Guidebook for Small Group Citizen Discussions (2nd edition, 2009)\u2014a guide for facilitating Public Discussions, Guidebook for Student-Centered Classroom Discussions (1st edition, 2008)\u2014a guide for teachers facilitating college classroom discussions</p><p>The following Teaching Aids have been published and are publicly available:</p><p>Guidebook for Student-Centered Classroom Discussions (1st edition, 2008)\u2014a guide for teachers facilitating college classroom discussions,</p><p>Teaching Tips (Byrd, Prudhomme &amp; Lea, eds., 2009),</p><p>Student-Centered Discussion Strategies for the 21st Century Classroom (Lea &amp; Byrd, 200)\u2014an IF White Paper,</p><p>Diversity in the Student-Centered Classroom (Lea &amp; Horowitz, 2009)\u2014an IF White Paper,</p><p>An Integrated Approach for the Development of Communication Skills (Byrd and Lea, 2009)\u2014an IF White Paper,</p><p>Practical Approaches to Communications (Byrd, 2009),</p><p>A Typical Week in the IF Classroom (Lea, 2009),</p><p>Stories for Interactive Exploration (Byrd, Lea &amp; Prudhomme, eds., 2009)</p><p>The following \u201cWhite Papers\u201d and academic papers have been published and are publicly available:</p><p>Contrasting Possibilities and the Interactivity Foundation Discussion Process (Gundersen, 2nd edition, 2009)\u2014an IF White Paper,</p><p>An Integrated Approach for the Development of Communication Skills (Byrd and Lea, 2009)\u2014an IF White Paper,</p><p>Student-Centered Discussion Strategies for the 21st Century Classroom (Lea &amp; Byrd, 2009)\u2014an IF White Paper,</p><p>Diversity in the Student Centered Classroom (Lea &amp; Horowitz, 2009)\u2014an IF White Paper,</p><p>Public Discussion as the Exploration &amp; Development of Contrasting Conceptual Possibilities (Gundersen, Stern, ed., 2006),</p><p>Why Political Science Should Teach democratic Facilitation\u2014and How (Gundersen, Byrd, Prudhomme, 2006)</p><p>Other Publications:</p><p>Plenary Review (Prudhomme and Gundersen, 2008),</p><p>A Brief Description of the Interactivity Foundation\u2019s Sanctuary and Public Discussions (Gundersen, 2007),</p><p>An Overview of the IF Discussion Process \u2013 3 stages (Prudhomme, 2009),</p><p>Beyond Troop Levels (Boyer, 2009),</p><p>Climate Change Possibilities (Boyer, 2009),</p><p>Julius \u201cJay\u201d Stern: A Biography (Hopkinson, 2010) <a id=\"The_Interactivity_Foundation_in_the_Media\" name=\"The_Interactivity_Foundation_in_the_Media\"></a></p><h2>The Interactivity Foundation in the Media</h2><p>June 28, 2010: Adolf Gundersen and Jeff Prudhomme, Fellows of the IF, published their short essay \"How to Keep Wall Street Under Control\" on CNN.com.<a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p><p>The Interactivity Foundation has a Facebook Fan Page.

The president\u2019s goal with this project was to make the government \u201cinclusive, transparent, accountable, and responsible\u201d (1). Through the OPE, the American public can voice their concerns about issues concerning our nation, and they can make their voices heard within the administration.</p><p>The goal of the OPE is to facilitate two-way discussion between the American public and the administration, through public, face-to-face events, as well as online resources. The American public can read about the activities of the OPE and the White House on the OPE blog, and can directly contact the OPE via an online form. In return, staff members from the OPE (if requested) will personally respond to messages they receive. In addition the OPE works side by side with the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs to assist with public outreach efforts (1).</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>On his first day as President of the United States, Barak Obama issued a memo to leaders of executive departments and government agencies, asserting that \u201cwe will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration\u201d (3). Thus began a series of events in an effort to launch Obama\u2019s plan for a government that was more open and transparent to the American people.</p><p>In late March of 2009, members of the National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD), including AmericaSpeaks, Everyday Democracy, and Demos, held a one-day meeting about Obama\u2019s Open Government Directive. At the meeting, which also involved representatives from 23 different federal agencies and offices, attendees discussed not only the technological and transparency issues of the President\u2019s plan, but also considered the idea of incorporating face-to-face interaction with online interactions (3).</p><p>Previously the Office of Public Liaison, the Office of Public Engagement was launched by President Obama on May 11, 2009. In previous presidencies, the Office of Public Liaison had the primary purpose of communicating and working with lobbyist and special interest groups around the country (7). President Obama felt, however, that there needed to be greater opportunity to allow the American public to participate in government issues, events, and discussions. In May of 2009, Obama announced that the \u201coffice would seek to engage as many Americans as possible in the difficult work of changing this country, through meetings and conversations with groups and individuals held in Washington and across the country\u201d (2). Instead of only communicating with special interest and lobbyist groups, Obama wanted to be able to create a way in which every American could engage in a two-way dialogue with his administration. Americans could voice their questions and concerns, and the administration could better inform the public about day-to-day goings on in the White House.</p><p>Along with the development of the OPE, Obama announced the creation of the Citizens\u2019 Briefing Handbook. Using the website, change.gov, ordinary, everyday citizens were given the opportunity to submit, reflect over, and vote on various ideas and issues they felt the Obama administration should address. In the end over 44,000 ideas were submitted by about 125,000 users, and 1.4 million votes were cast; some of the most popular ideas accumulated tens of thousands of votes. The Citizens\u2019 Briefing Handbook, contains some of those ideas which received the most votes, such as introduction of age-appropriate sex education to replace abstinence-only education, making \u201cgreen\u201d improvements such as a national high-speed rail system, and eliminating the military\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy. The book contains actual, unedited comments and concerns, put forth by American citizens. Once all of the top ideas were compiled, the book was delivered to President Obama (7).</p><p>There are currently 21 individuals on staff in the Office of Public Engagement. The current leadership in the OPE includes Valerie Jarrett (Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement); Christina M. Tchen (Director of the Office of Public Engagement); and Michael Strautmanis (Chief of Staff to the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations and Public Engagement) (6).</p><p><a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>Website- The Office of Public Engagement has their own official website, <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ope</a>. Through the OPE website, anyone can access the OPE Blog, biographies about the OPE staff members, and even a page which can be used to contact the OPE directly. On the \u2018Contact\u2019 page is an option where you can request a response, thereby facilitating the two-way communication that President Obama is striving for.</p><p>Blog- The Office of Public Engagement keeps a blog that can be accessed through the OPE website. The blog is updated a few times per month by staff members in the OPE, and highlights White House and OPE events that might not necessarily get news coverage, but that the public might want to know about. For example, the most recent entry, posted on October 9, 2010, discusses the involvement of Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to the President, in the \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d project, a nationwide campaign that addresses the struggles faced by young gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender individuals.</p><p>Anyone can subscribe to the blog and receive e-mails when the blog is updated. In addition to text, the blog also includes pictures and video that can be viewed by the public. The OPE Blog also includes links to all of the other White House blogs, as well as a Blog Archive, which is organized by date, as well as by issue; people can read blog entries from different areas of the White House based on which issues concern them the most, such as education, the economy, health care, immigration, veteran\u2019s issues, or social security issues (5).</p><p>Public Events- The OPE, in seeking to gain feedback from Americans outside of the Washington, D.C. area, reaches out to the rest of the nation through public events and town meetings, during which everyday citizens can come out and voice their opinions and concerns about issues that are important to them, such as health care, the environment, and education (7). In addition to in-person public events, the OPE also organizes online forums which function as \"virtual town halls\", where Americans can join in the discussion of topics that concern them, such as healthcare (7). Some examples of public events that have been held in the past are an online community health forum in Michigain, as well as a town hall meeting in California.</p><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>The White House Office of Public Engagement is funded by the United States federal government.</p><p><a id=\"Major_Projects\" name=\"Major_Projects\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects</h2><p>The OPE discusses many of its major projects on its blog. Most recently, on August 3, 2010, President Obama hosted 115 young African leaders during a three-day event, the President\u2019s Forum for Young African Leaders. During this forum, representatives from many different African countries were able to share their thoughts and visions for the future of their countries, and for the future of Africa as a whole (5). Other major projects of the OPE include reaching out to various distinguished groups in our nation, such as youth (U.S. Senate Youth Program, Big Brothers and Big Sisters of the Year, Children\u2019s Miracle Network Champions, etc.), the disabled (celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, supporting the Paralympics, etc.), and Native Americans (support of the Recovery Act, which awarded $224 million to enable Indian tribes to build and renovate prisons and jails on tribal land) (5). First and foremost, however, the OPE\u2019s major project is to be the mediator of communications between the administration and the American people. It is the major purpose of the OPE to give a voice to the American people, and to make sure that their views are heard by the administration.</p><p>As mentioned above, one of the major projects of the OPE was the Citizen's Briefing Handbook, the book full of American citizens' ideas and concerns about our country. Categories within the book included Economy; Education; Energy/Environment; Foreign Policy; Healthcare; Homeland Security; Service; Technology; and Veterans, as well as additional issues such as the legality of marijuana and marriage equality (8).</p><p>Top vote-earning ideas under each of these categories include:</p><p>Economy -Revoke Bush Tax Cuts for top 1% earners; Make reduced-scale farming affordable; less dependence on imported foods</p><p>Education -End government-sponsored abstinence education; introduce age appropriate sex-education</p><p>Environment Committ to becoming the \"greenest\" country in the world; Introduce/increase use of bullet trains and light rail systems; Increase MPG requirements on new cars</p><p>Foreign Policy -Permanent closure of facilities such as Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib</p><p>Healthcare -Stop using federal resources to undermine states' medical marijuana laws</p><p>Homeland Security -Eliminate \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\"; Find a balance between U.S. security and civil liberties</p><p>Service -National Service Corps</p><p>Technology -Boost America's economy by legalizing online poker; Each of the 50 state governors should create their own version of the Citizen's Briefing Handbook to gather ideas</p><p>Veterans -Signing bonuses for enlistment should not be revoked due to injuries beyond the control of the soldiers; Do away with unacceptable tour extensions</p><p><a id=\"Secondary_Literature\" name=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a></p><h2>Secondary Literature</h2><p>-Citizen's Briefing Handbook.

Through economic, environmental, physical, and human growth they are able to take steps and make goals in order to revitalize their neighborhood. \"DSNI works to implement resident-driven plans with non-profit organizations, community development corporations, businesses, and religious groups.\"<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.dsni.org/history.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.dsni.org/history.shtml\">[1]</a> The Dudley Street Neighborhood has progressively grown into a joint effort of over 3,000 volunteers committed to renew this culturally diverse neighborhood of over 24,000 people. DSNI is the only community-based nonprofit in the country which has been granted eminent domain authority over abandoned properties within its boundaries. The eminent domain authority was applied to the vacant land in a 60 acre area called the \"Dudley Triangle\" This organization aims to achieve affordability, while also preserving the neighborhoods character. The Dudley Street Neighborhood is committed to continuing the efforts of the combined community, and with their community collaboration they hope to create affordability, permanence, and pride for the Dudley neighborhood. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>By the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of the homes in the community adjoining Dudley Street had been abandoned or burned by property owners in hopes of profit or fear of gentrification. The vacant land was being used as a dumping zone for garbage, sanitation companies, and contractors working on nearby urban renewal projects would dispose of their refuse on the lots. The city began to appear as a garbage dump or junkyard with abandoned cars along the street sides. In the early 1980s, a group of women started a campaign, called \"Don't Dump on Us.\" This campaign gained the attention of the public and the Mayor. This began the start to revitalization through the help of the city. It began to regulate the abandoned lots and participated in clearing away the broken down cars, and waste. Following the initiatives success, \"the group met with a class at MIT to develop a long-term plan for revitalizing the neighborhood.\" <a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://web.ebscohost.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=d1ff3f1a-26d4-4c95-87d0-033a6d86ead8%40sessionmgr12\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://web.ebscohost.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=d1ff3f1a-26d4-4c95-87d0-033a6d86ead8%40sessionmgr12\">[2]</a> A local Boston foundation gave its support, however not much impact was noticed. This was due to the foundation dispersing their money to a number of smaller projects, rather than only one. This foundation then redirected their efforts, and fully invested into Dudley Street. However, redevelopment plans were hindered due to the inconsistency of land within the neighborhood. The city had taken over approximately half of the land from past tax delinquency and those pieces were in the way for DSNIs plans. DSNI realized that a Massachusetts law could enable them to gain eminent domain<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain\">[3]</a>over much of the community's abandoned parcels. After four years of dealing with the court and convincing the City Hall, Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative gained the right of nearly one-half of the land in the neighborhood. Dudley Street Initiative had to then find the funds to purchase this newly available land. The Riley Foundation supported DSNI amounting to $1.4 million through the years, and contributed to the legal work on the eminent domain case. Without sizable support from banks and conventional lenders, finding the money to fund the purchase of the land was difficult. The Ford Foundation agreed to make a $2 million loan. From this $2 million loan, D.S.N.I. was able to grow immensely and has continued to prosper.</p><p>Of the neighborhoods 24,000 residents, 40% are African-Americans, 30% Latin Americans mostly from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, 24% Cape Verdeans, from islands off the coast of West Africa, and 6% Whites mostly elderly Irish and Italians who have lived in the neighborhood since the 1950s.</p><p>The organizations active membership has grown steadily, and now numbers near 3,600. More the 150 people met to plan out the future of Dudley Street Neighborhood in an eight-month series of meetings that were conducted in Spanish, Cape Verdean as well as English. The membership board came up with a wide- ranging plan that focused on maintaining culture, and building the community spirit through new opportunities, housing, and youth involvement. To this day, bike paths, a community center, community gardens fountains, art programs, a town commons, youth programs, parent meetings, and college opportunities have been made possible for this neighborhood.</p><p>Today:</p><p>There are more than 3,600 members, over half of 1,300 vacant lots have been transformed into homes, parks, playgrounds, gardens, schools, community centers and a Town Common. There are over 400 new homes built since the start of DSNI, and residents who were children at the start of DSNI are now active leaders in the community <a id=\"Specializations_and_Activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_Activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and Activities</h2><p>DSNI holds Board Meetings, tutoring opportunities, neighborhood meetings, and events for the youth and children of the area. They encourage meetings to help the academic education of the youth in their neighborhood. They provide activities where parents along with children can receive special information on testing, college, or other options for schooling. Many of their activities are to encourage community involvement and to have active members of their community. <a id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2><p>The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative is governed by a 34-member Board of Directors. Community-wide board elections are held every two years at the DSNI Annual Meeting. For the Board of Directors, equal representation is provided for the community's four major cultures-African American, Cape Verdean, Latino, and White. The structure of the DSNI board is as follows:</p><p>16 Residents from the whole area</p><p>5 Nonprofit agencies representing the Health and Human Service fields from the core area</p><p>2 Community Development Corporations from the core area</p><p>2 Small Businesses from the core area</p><p>2 Religious Organizations from the core area</p><p>3 Youths from the core area (ages 15-18)</p><p>2 Nonprofit organizations or groups fro, the secondary area</p><p>2 Residents appointed by the newly elected board</p><p>Agreeing to be on the Board of Directors of the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, all members must make a pledge to \"empower Dudley residents to organize, plan for, create and control a vibrant, diverse, and high quality neighborhood in collaboration with community partners.\" They then further pledge to support the residents' and community's right to shape all plans, programs, and policies affecting their quality of life. The pledge also includes to control the development of neighborhood land, live in a healthy and safe family, supportive environments, the right to education/career/economic opportunities, quality, affordable housing and child care, safe accessible public transportation, quality services, and a full spiritual and religious life.</p><p>Dudley Neighbors Incorporated (DNI)</p><p>The Dudley Neighbors was created by the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative to achieve the housing development portion of DSNI's plan for revitalization. In 1988 DNI's request to become a Massachusetts 121A Corporation was approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA). This enabled DNI to obtain privately-owned vacant land in the area designated as the Dudley Triangle. These parcels of land are leased to private and nonprofit developers in order to build affordable housing within the Board of Directors master plan. \"DSNI\u2019s focus on community empowerment expresses their fundamental belief in the wisdom and collective power of the community, led by residents, to realize their shared vision.\"<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.dsni.org/Reports/Annual%20Report%20FY09.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.dsni.org/Reports/Annual%20Report%20FY09.pdf\">[4]</a></p><p>Dudley Youth Council (DYC)</p><p>DYC was formed by Dudley youth to empower and give a \"united youth voice\" in the Dudley area. <a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.dsni.org/youth.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.dsni.org/youth.shtml\">[5]</a> The mission was to empower and give motivation to youth in order to develop goals and plans.

They form a collaborative effort to provide youth jobs and connect them with opportunities to build valuable skills with the help of professionals. Ultimately they foster leadership among the youth, and help build a caring, strong community. They provide meaningful employment opportunities while also making available personal, emotional, and intellectual supports. The nonprofits involved continue to strengthen and develop their capacity to work with teens.</p><p>Dudley Children Thrive: Community Developing Children (DCT)</p><p>This is a new initiative created by a group of local agencies arranged by Dudley Street Initiative. DCT works directly with Children\u2019s Services of Roxbury, Project Hope, and La Alianz Hispana as partners in discovering and handling the needs of Dudley neighborhood children up to 5 years. Their united mission is to begin by academically strengthening the children from a young age, to develop high achieving and successful children. Dudley Children Thrive hopes to initiate a bar of excellence by educating families and educators with programs, resources, and information.</p><p>College Bound</p><p>DSNI\u2019s College Bound program introduces Dudley neighborhood youth to opportunities available to them after high school.

These participants alone will have a very different opinion then those who are not directly residents but are from the church or local businesses. This enables the Board to accurately meet all the demands and touch on all bases of concern, criticism, or support. Within these meetings are translators to ensure comprehension among every member. The Board of Directors must all sign a DSNI Board Pledge which in one aspect participants must agree to support the residents' and community's right to \"shape all plans, programs, and policies affecting our quality of life.\" <a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.dsni.org/board.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.dsni.org/board.shtml\">[7]</a> This pledge alone holds every member of the board, all which are residents or community members, accountable to showing respect in opinions and thoughts that take place during the meetings and outside.

The have executed a deliberative practice in both their neighborhood meetings, and through their diverse Board of Directors. An additional idea that would only strengthen their quality of deliberation would be to create more frequently available meetings, open for all residents of the neighborhood to come. There could be separate meetings available for the different ethnic groups or areas of town, on specified dates, where they could attend and express their concerns or ideas together, comfortably. Then approximately two members from each of these meeting groups would come together to present their data. This would be a structured meeting where every group of people is able to have an educated opinion from those of their nationality or area of town. Different areas of town, or different ethnic groups may express different needs or concerns affecting them directly. This would be an accumulation of information from a larger sample of residents in the neighborhood. More ideas may be expressed and others may reflect on those opinions presented. <a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.dsni.org/dni/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.dsni.org/dni/\">http://www.dsni.org/dni/</a></p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.dsni.org/youth.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.dsni.org/youth.shtml\">http://www.dsni.org/youth.shtml</a></p><p>Choosing Healing Over Saving by Gregory A Smith</p><p>Encounter; Spring2004, Vol. 17 Issue 1, p31-37, 7p <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://web.ebscohost.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;hid=17&amp;sid=7e4bf08f-95cd-492d-a783-264da996f298%40sessionmgr14\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://web.ebscohost.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;hid=17&amp;sid=7e4bf08f-95cd-492d-a783-264da996f298%40sessionmgr14\">http://web.ebscohost.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;hid=17&amp;sid=7e4bf08f-95cd-492d-a783-264da996f298%40sessionmgr14</a></p><p>\"Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative.\" DATA.ED.GOV.

By doing so, new standards will be expected for their projects and thus, will result in new developments to better the organization and its practices in the future years to come. \n</p><p>(5) Lastly, GOV2U is able to ultimately have the Global Leadership Profile they wish to attain through sharing their knowledge and creativity \u201cto the community of public, academic, civil, and private professionals and citizens through workshops, seminars, and conferences.\u201d This not only helps their public relations images but also establishes them as a credible, strong, and branded source that others would trust because its great presence.\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2> History </h2>\n<p>In 2005, a group of professionals from the fields of Legislative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and community activism, including its current Executive Director, Vasilis Koulolias, created a non-profit, non-governmental organization now known as GOV2U to better citizens\u2019 participation in the decision making processes of their governments.

The Council was formed in the 1950s after the Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Brown v.

Patterson</a>, The Citizens' Council in efforts to resist desegregation was formed on July 11, 1954. It was started in Indianola, MS, and expanded to other states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Missouri. It attracted middle to upper-class civilians, most of them politicians, doctors, lawyers, teachers, bankers, and businessmen. The Citizens\u2019 Council lasted approximately 25 years, from 1954 \u2013 1979.<a href=\"#cite_note-UMS-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\n</p><p>Unlike the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Ku Klux Klan\"> Ku Klux Klan  </a> and other racist groups during the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_movement\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"civil rights movement\">civil rights movement</a>, the Citizens' Council was not rooted in violence. Instead, the Citizens' Council focused on using economic, social and political pressures to oppress African Americans and supporters. While common stereotypes perceive racism to be behavior exemplified by the working and uneducated class, the Citizens\u2019 Council proved that racism was well practiced by educated, upper class citizens. Characterized by their fear of miscegenation, the Citizens\u2019 Council chronicled an important time in American history when it was not a law, but the people themselves that restricted each other from achieving civil rights. As Earl Johnson, a former member of the Citizens\u2019 Council writes, \u201c\u2026it looked like to me that the Citizens' Council was just stirring up hate among whites and really was accomplishing nothing except just building an organization of members paying dues.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-JOHNSTON-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a> The Citizens' Council monitored all aspects of life in the Deep South with the aid of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Jim Crow laws\"> Jim Crow laws</a> hoping to retain the status quo prior to the move towards integration. They heavily influenced outcomes of elections, health care policies, economic sanctions and progress, school districts, and other agenda.\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that \u201cin the field of public education, the doctrine of \u2018separate but equal\u2019 has no place. Separate but unequal education facilities are inherently unequal.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a>  The Court further ruled that segregation in any public place was unequal. This proclamation for integration was celebrated by black Americans everywhere, but in the South it was received with skepticism. Known infamously as \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Black Monday\">Black Monday</a>,\u201d Southern whites were greatly concerned with the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision, and many felt the threat of this change in status quo.  Mississippi Senator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_O._Eastland\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"James O. Eastland\">James O. Eastland </a> said, \"On May 17, 1954, the Constitution of the United States was destroyed because of the Supreme Court's decision.

Robert \u201cTut\u201d Patterson, a plantation manager, led the chapter.  Attendance was approximately 100 people, including the town mayor and civic attorney. By August 1955, membership in the Citizens\u2019 Council had exceeded 60,000 people, and included 253 Councils. In August 1956, the Citizens\u2019 Council had expanded to 30 states to form the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%E2%80%99_Council_of_America\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Citizens\u2019 Council of America\">Citizens\u2019 Council of America</a>. Under the goal to preserve the \u201cnatural\u201d rights of racial segregation and the \u201cmaintenance of our States\u2019 Rights to regulate public health, morals, marriage, education, peace and good order in the States, under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Membership for the Citizens\u2019 Councils peaked at 250,000 in 1957. The Citizens\u2019 Council of America boasted a strong board of advisors, including Senator James O. Eastland and Representative John Bell Williams of Mississsippi, Senator J. Strom Thurmond and Representative L. Mendel of South Carolina, and Governor Marvin Griffin of Georgia.  <a href=\"#cite_note-UMS-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\n</p><p>In April 1957, a fifteen-minute telecast, \u201cForum\u201d began its weekly broadcast over WLBT-TV in Jackson. Telecasts were shown by twelve stations across Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia, and radio tapes were broadcasted over fifty stations in the South. In 1962, the Civil Rights Act practically all but destroyed the Citizens\u2019 Council\u2019s years of work as racial integration became more widely popular and the councils\u2019 advocacy started to backfire. That September 29, President Kennedy federalized Mississippi National Guard troops to force integration at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"University of Mississippi\">University of Mississippi</a> (Ole Miss). <a href=\"#cite_note-SOUTH-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a>\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sovereignty_Commission_(see_below)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"The Sovereignty Commission (see below)\">The Sovereignty Commission</a> announced on October 19, 1964 that monthly payments to \u201cForum\u201d would be reduced from $4,500 to $2,000. Viewer attention started to dwindle, and by December 1964, only a few stations in Mississippi and neighboring states still regularly played \u201cForum\u201d programs. While the Citizens\u2019 Councils strived for in the late 1960s, the effects soon began to wear off. The decline can be explained by a number of reasons, but mostly Southerners grew wary of upholding such strict traditions in an era of forward thinking. As African Americans started to gain political, economic, and social status, businesses could no longer deny services to African Americans. Political leaders and other community official started to liberalize towards integration, and the balanced shifted favorably towards civil rights in the South. The social cultural change was generally accepted by Southern citizens, who became reluctant to associate with racist groups that were being condemned by the rest of the nation. \n</p><p>\nBy the 1970s, support had drastically diminished for the Citizens\u2019 Councils. There was a brief revival in 1985 for the Citizens\u2019 Council when a new group emerged dedicated to preserving the privileges of white America, <a href=\"http://cofcc.org/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://cofcc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC)</a>. Founded in St. Louis, MO in 1985 by leaders in the Citizens\u2019 Council, including Robert Patterson, the CCC had a more specific set of values on which they based the need for a European America.  The Citizens Council was eventually completely replaced by The Council of Conservative Citizens.  They still reserve the same extremist views of white supremacy and white separatism by promoting \u201cthe interests of European Americans\u201d today. <a href=\"#cite_note-CCC-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"The_Movement\" id=\"The_Movement\"></a><h2>The Movement</h2>\n<a name=\"Oppression\" id=\"Oppression\"></a><h3>Oppression</h3>\n<p>As Southern blacks began their civil rights movement through boycotts, protests, and other forms of revolt, Southern whites also began their own form of resistance. When Southern blacks boycotted the bus system in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955, the Citizens Council gained an exponential increase of membership. Southern blacks were evicted by landlords, fired by employers, denied credit by merchants, refused service, and assaulted. Other members worked to prevent African American voters from rolls, threatened to fire employees who registered to vote or integrate public facilities, and foreclosed businesses and farms.  <a href=\"#cite_note-WCC-5\" title=\"\">[6]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Education\" id=\"Education\"></a><h3>Education</h3>\n<p>Since the Citizens\u2019 Council\u2019s Movement was rooted in opposition for segregated education, it was no surprise that a good majority of attention was focused on school boards. The Dallas Citizens\u2019 Council was founded in 1957 with a membership of 25,000. Supported by Representative Joe N. Chapman of Sulphur Springs and Texas B.E. Masters, president emeritus of Kilgore JuniorCollege, the Texas Board of Education allowed states funds for desegregated school districts. In the small town of Hoxie, Arkansas, where Caucasian students outnumbered African American students by a ratio of 99 to 1, dissent for integration rose until the school board suspended classes for fall harvest weeks in advance. Angry parents picketed and boycotted students from school. In New Orleans, Louisiana, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leander_Perez\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Leander Perez\">Leander Perez </a>, a wealthy land owner, lawyer, and judge, was hired by the Orleans Parish School Board to help prevent desegregation. Perez preached that integration was a communist plot to weaken the country, using the slogan \u201cintegration is the Southern expression of communism.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-SOUTH-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a>  In Virginia, massive resistance was evident in extreme measures taken by school districts. Funding was eliminated for public schools attempting to integrate. Special privileges were given to white students, including grants to pay tuition for segregated private schools (excluded by Brown v. Board of Education), tax credits granted to parents who sent children to segregated schools, and additional funds were given to transport white students to segregated private schools. <a href=\"#cite_note-WEB-6\" title=\"\">[7]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Intimidation_.26_Violence\" id=\"Intimidation_.26_Violence\"></a><h3>Intimidation &amp; Violence</h3>\n<p>The Citizens\u2019 Council initially sought to distinguish from the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), but as their movement began to move towards extreme racial disparities, they soon became labeled as the \u201ccountry club Klan\u201d or \u201cuptown Klan.\u201d Black voter registration fell from 31.7% to 25.7% between 1956 and 1959 due to intimidation. <a href=\"#cite_note-SOUTH-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a> Direct violence committed by the Citizens' Council was hard to find, but the members of the Council often supported violence executed by the KKK.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Activities.2C_Major_Projects_.26_Events\" id=\"Activities.2C_Major_Projects_.26_Events\"></a><h2>Activities, Major Projects &amp; Events</h2>\n<p>In efforts to recreate old town meetings locally, the Citizens\u2019 Council movement urged local groups to meet and discuss ways to \u201cmeet any crisis by expressing the will of the people.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-COMMENTARY-7\" title=\"\">[8]</a> The Citizens\u2019 Councils of America encouraged local white Americans to disrupt daily living for African Americans and sympathizers. Below are a few examples that occurred:\n</p><p>Mississippi was a crucial state in the segregationist movement. They claimed a membership of 80,000 in 1956. In 1959, the Citizens\u2019 Council played a key role in electing Ross Barnett, a segregationist, to the Governor\u2019s Office. \n</p><p>\nAt a large public meeting on May 17, 1956, the Citizens' Council of Greater New Orleans launched an attack on the Urban League, an integrated organization devoted to developing job opportunities for blacks. Leander Perez attacked the Urban League as \"a communist organization\" and denounced a list of its board members in public. <a href=\"#cite_note-SOUTH-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a> \n</p><p>\nOn Feburary 10, 1956, twelve thousand whites filled the state coliseum in Montgomery at a Citizens\u2019 Council rally featuring Senator James O.

The Citizens' Councils especially attracted wealthy members of society who were more than willing to donate for a worthy cause. Membership was open to anyone who fit the correct description: white, powerful, and racist. Members paid dues and attended weekly meetings in local homes, courthouses, schools, and other locations.  A typical meeting in Mississippi is described by Erle Johnston, former director of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission:\n</p>\n<blockquote>Big speaker [would] get up and say, \"We're not going to let the federal government do so-and-so.

Give us your money.\" So people would give their money and leave there, and they would feel better, like an emotional purgative, even though no plan had been adopted; no course had been assumed.<a href=\"#cite_note-JOHNSTON-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a> </blockquote>\n<p>The other way to receive revenue was from the publicly-funded<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Sovereignty_Commission\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission\">  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission</a>, an agency that promoted segregation. In 1956, the Mississippi legislature formed the State Sovereignty Commission. The Sovereignty Commission contributed generous funds to the Citizens\u2019 Council, and also offered their investigation through a covert network that tracked blacks and whites. <a href=\"#cite_note-UMS-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a> \n</p><p>The Citizens\u2019 Council did not keep specific records, but speculation estimates its annual budget in 1956 to be around 400,000 in Mississippi alone. William J. Simmons estimated the budget to have fallen to around 200,000 by 1963.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Publications\" id=\"Publications\"></a><h2>Publications</h2>\n<p>As the Citizens\u2019 Council spread into other states, many started to use propaganda to spread the message. On October 15, 1955 the Citizens\u2019 Council in Mississippi released the first issue of The Citizens\u2019 Council, a pro-segregationist newspaper. By 1960, 50,000 copies of the issue were circulating on average, and television and radio broadcasts were also available for program. Other Citizens\u2019 Council pamphlets often carried messages describing African Americans as having \u201can inherent deficiency in mental ability\u201d and \u201ca natural indolence.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-EXTREME-10\" title=\"\">[11]</a> The monthly four page newspaper contained news from area newspapers, essays from advocates, and articles of similar campaigns in South Africa. Both American and African blacks were portrayed as sexual predators or caricatured as African savages, cannibals, and witch doctors incapable of self-control through cartoons and writing. <a href=\"#cite_note-CCC-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a>  \n</p><p>\nThe notorious Black Monday, title referring to the day of Brown v. Board of Education , was written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pickens_Brady\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Thomas Pickens Brady\"> Thomas Pickens Brady</a>, a Mississippi circuit court judge. The handbook became a staple in the Citizens\u2019 Council\u2019s movement. \n</p><p>\nIn 1956, Patterson published a series of five pamphlets. Patterson used powerful politicians to support his main points: incorporated into his pamphlets were an article by former Supreme Court Justice James F. Brynes of South Carolina, a speech by state Attorney General Eugene Cook of Georgia, and addresses by Senator James O. Eastland and Representative John Bell Williams. Patterson went on to publish sets of single-sheet leaflets which boasted statistics to show that crime, illegitimacy, and venereal disease were more prevalent in blacks than whites.\n</p><p>\nIn January 1956, Montgomery mayor W.A. Gayle joined the Citizens\u2019 Council, publicly declaring that \u201cevery right-right thinking white person in Montgomery, Alabama and the South should do the same.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-KING-11\" title=\"\">[12]</a> By February, membership had doubled. Martin Luther King wrote to President Dwight D. Eisenhower asking him to investigate the Citizens\u2019 Council violence.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Present_Day\" id=\"Present_Day\"></a><h2>Present Day</h2>\n<p>Today, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Conservative_Citizens_(CofCC)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC)\">Council of Conservative Citizens</a> continues to exists, and is headquartered in St. Louis, MO.

The \u201cStatement of Principles\u201d begins with a declaration: \u201cThe American men and women who make up the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) believe in, commit themselves to, and pledge to work for and support these fundamental principles of American civilization, liberty, justice, and national safety.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-CCC-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a> A list of 14 points detail the  from the United States as a Christian country, the preservation of European peoples in the United States, to specific policies on family, the environment, national and state law.

By conforming to each other\u2019s racist ideals, the Citizens\u2019 Council united under a common fear of integration. Deliberation is the act of interaction through peoples as they evaluate choices and reach solutions. When members met for their weekly meetings and discussed recent news, deliberation occurred because they tried to address current issues by gathering resources and agreeing on actions to be taken. But why did such a vast movement of a shared political thinking fail?  Political Communication and Deliberation , written by John Gastil, explains the necessary components of deliberation. At the analytical level, the spread of information through mass media successfully created a solid information base for users, and clearly identified a set of values that defined the Citizens\u2019 Council. Yet, the organization ultimately failed to continue its influence on society as the civil rights movement was embraced by the rest of the nation. The Citizens\u2019 Council largely focused on the process of enticing members to join, while following up on results or brainstorming various ways to execute their opinions. At the social level, the Citizens\u2019 Council adequately fulfilled criteria to ensure mutual comprehension, but failed to respects its citizenry by giving the average citizen little opportunity to express their experiences to the big leaders that charismatically led the way. The Councils were hardly a community-friendly organization as they were controlled by the most rich and most powerful of society. The decline of this organization can only be accredited to the lack of coherent political deliberation. \n</p>\n<a name=\"Groupthink\" id=\"Groupthink\"></a><h3>Groupthink</h3>\n<p>The Citizens\u2019 Council is a notable organization of deliberation because it fulfills many groupthink proposals. For one, it brought together individuals in society who identified their lifestyles based on a specific set of beliefs. By first creating an identity that related to the movement, the Citizens\u2019 Council could draw more support by easily appealing to their shared views. That mere opinions at a local level could be magnified to a national scale of racial segregation is a remarkable accomplishment. Another praiseworthy quality of the Citizens\u2019 Council was its ability to mobilize the populace at a local level. Though there was disconnect between states, all of the councils had the same \u201cinherent morality\u201d to maintain segregation.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-GASTIL-12\" title=\"\">[13]</a> By maintain a stereotyped view of the opposing group\u2019s motivations (\u201cAfrican Americans are bad.\u201d) while secretly keeping negative news or flaws hidden to avoid dispute (ie. Not discussing a new civil rights group, not presenting the latest discovery of integration cities, etc), members of the Citizens\u2019 Council fell into a monotonous duty to their segregationist ideals. Despite its power and effectiveness, groupthink can be for large groups, many also believe it is an explanation for policy disasters. Flawed decisions are inevitable in a groupthink dynamic since no one dares to question a policy strategy or make suggestions.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Lack_of_Communication\" id=\"Lack_of_Communication\"></a><h3>Lack of Communication</h3>\n<p>The Citizens\u2019 Council\u2019s eventual demise can only be attributed to its lack of deliberation at a larger scope. The movement had difficulty working jointly with other states because each council focused solely on matters that could be handled locally. If Councils had formed monthly or semi-annual meetings for all those involved in Citizens\u2019 Council of America, or even at the state level between cities, the Citizens\u2019 Council surely would have survived the more revolutionary civil rights agenda that destroyed the Citizens\u2019 Council.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Political_Language\" id=\"Political_Language\"></a><h3>Political Language</h3>\n<p>One of the more manipulative political influences the Citizens\u2019 Council fostered was the usage of powerful words to manipulate the public at large. Much like the political scientist Murray Edelman described with the word crisis, repetitive usage of the Citizens\u2019 Council for words like racism, dirty, disease, and other derogatory adjectives for African Americans confused normal citizenry enough to the Councils\u2019 advantage. As Edelman pointed out, \u201ccrisis language maybe used to encourage the\u2026population to accept [the proposed ideas],\u201d and furthermore often \u201crelaxes resistance to governmental interferences with civil liberties and bolsters support for executive actions, including discouragement of suppression of criticism.\" <a href=\"#cite_note-GASTIL-12\" title=\"\">[13]</a>  Such practice was commonly used by the Citizens\u2019 Councils through their campaigns and propaganda, and extremely effective during the organization's earlier years.\n</p>\n<a name=\"External_Links\" id=\"External_Links\"></a><h2>External Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/125th/newsevents/stories/061810dnmetdcc125.b7765fb8.html\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/125th/newsevents/stories/061810dnmetdcc125.b7765fb8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dallas Citizens' Council</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://cofcc.org/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://cofcc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Council of Conservative Citizens</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.citizenscouncils.com/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.citizenscouncils.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Citizens' Council</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://orig.jacksonsun.com/civilrights/sec2_citizencouncil.shtml\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://orig.jacksonsun.com/civilrights/sec2_citizencouncil.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Jackson Sun</a>\n</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/othersrv/isar/Institut/CCC/\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/othersrv/isar/Institut/CCC/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Institute for the Study of Academic Racism</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Secondary_Literature\" id=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a><h2>Secondary Literature</h2>\n<p>McMillen, Niel R.

Budgets are the government\u2019s most powerful tool to meet the needs and priorities of a country and its people. The aim of the IBP is to ensure that government budgets are more immediate to the needs of poor and low-income people in society and, to make budget systems more apparent and responsible to the public.</p><p>The IBP believes that the public has a right to wide-ranging, timely, and valuable information on how the government manages public funds. This allows for the identifications of a broad range of solutions. Their experience shows that when ordinary people have a chance to be involved and informed, broader public engagement in government budget processes can promote large improvements in governance and poverty. \u201cIn order to foster more open, participatory, and accountable public budgeting, the IBP partners with civil society organizations around the world, leveraging their knowledge of their country\u2019s political context, their experience navigating policy processes for social change, and their relationships with the public in order to transform their country\u2019s budget system.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-IBP-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>What does IBP do? Five Major Steps:</p><p>1. Building budget analysis and advocacy skills through training and technical assistance. This allows for education on budgets which helps create a solid information base.</p><p>2. Measuring and advancing transparency, accountability, and public participation in the budget process.</p><p>3. Contributing to strong and sustainable organizations by providing financial assistance for civil society budget work.</p><p>4. Enhancing knowledge exchange among civil society budget groups and other public finance stakeholders by acting as a hub of information on civil society budget work. This helps weigh the pros and cons of each budget work, allowing for the best to be chosen.</p><p>5. Building vibrant international and regional budget networks, finding the top possible solutions.</p><p>What is the impact of this?</p><p>The IBP and civil society organizations that work together hope to contribute on how governments can reform the managing of public funds around the world.</p><p>This allows for the budget process (being the proposal of budgets, the deliberative debates on them, how they are implemented and how they are assessed) to be known to the public and how they are able to add input. The needs of the poor and marginalized are effectively addressed by the budget policies and how the budget rules, institutions and regulations are stronger and able to resist corruption and poor management. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>\u201cIn 1985 Disha, a civil society organization (CSO) in Gujarat, India, wanted the government to address several issues affecting poor people living in tribal areas, including land rights and support for Tendu leaf-plucker women. Although Disha was well-equipped with economic and moral arguments and were seasoned advocates, they realized that without hard data on how the national and local governments were currently using, and planning to use, public funds to support tribal development, it would be nearly impossible to convince the government to address these issues. So Disha began to gather this data and use it to advocate for stronger policies for poor, tribal people.Thus was born one of the first \u201cbudget groups\u201d \u2014 CSOs that analyze government budgets and undertake advocacy to influence these budgets in order to improve policies, service delivery, and outcomes, particularly for the poor.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-IBP-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>Why Civil Society Budget Work?</p><p>Public budgets are the outlines for how the government will raise and use the public funds needed for the policies and programs. Though the budget directly impacts all of a nation\u2019s people, usually the public has been shut out of the processes through which these decisions are made.</p><p>This allows for people from all over to participate, creating an equal deliberative model for expansion in the world. With the help of people around the world, IBP hopes to make the best decision possible for all countries. This attitude has begun to change in the past decade, influenced largely by increasing efforts by civil society organizations to participate in government budget processes in order to affect policy choices and make public budgeting more open and accountable. It is being recognized that when ordinary people are involved in managing the public\u2019s money, you get stronger decisions and better outcomes for the people, especially the poor people.</p><p>Two things need to happen to make this work. One: governments need to provide the public with information and chance to participate in the budget process. Two: civil society and the public need the skills to understand and use this information to effectively promote for better plans.</p><p>Based on this belief, the International Budget Partnership was formed in 1997 within the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href=\"#cite_note-CBPP-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a> to collaborate with general society to start budget analysis and advocacy in order to improve governance and decrease poverty. The IBP invests in civil society\u2019s capacity to understand and analyze government budgets and participate in budget processes.</p><p>\u201cThe work of the IBP is fueled by these core assumptions:</p><p>\u2022 Public understanding and engagement are necessary if public budgeting processes are to be reformed and budgets are to be more responsive.</p><p>\u2022 Successful CSO engagement requires that citizens have access to information and opportunities to participate in the formulation, implementation, and oversight of public policies and budgets.</p><p>\u2022 Government has the primary duty to provide the public with timely, comprehensive information on the budget and opportunities for participation in budget processes.</p><p>\u2022 Government has the primary duty to ensure that the maximum available public funds are devoted to reductions in poverty. Public funds should be spent on public priorities, especially those of the poor and marginalized.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-IBP-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a> <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>IBP\u2019s Electronic Publications \u2013 documents and promotes the budget work that is done and the organizations that make it possible. This is a free bimonthly newsletter that anyone can subscribe to. This creates a solid information base for the people that are interested in learning about budget work.</p><p>Open Budget Blog/International Budget Listserv \u2013 these are both ongoing discussions on current budget issues and people are able to participate and also able to start new feeds. This allows for discussion by all types of people by adequately distributing speaking opportunities. This is a very deliberative means for which people can help others ensure for mutual comprehension while considering other ideas and experiences. <a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>The International Budget Partnership collaborates with a large and diverse network of civil society organizations (CSOs) around the world. The IBP \u2014 through the Partnership Initiative (PI), the Open Budget Initiative (OBI), and the Training Program \u2014 provides re-grants and technical assistance to a wide range of organizations. \u201cAll together, during 2009, the IBP made grants totaling $1,929,000 to 47 organizations in 33 countries, plus an additional $825,000 in pass-through grants to two organizations.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-Funding-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a></p><p>The IBP also provides a number of smaller grants to strengthen support. These grants contribute to a coordinated campaign within and across countries, but with a narrower focus than the Partnership Initiative. The Open Budget Initiative seeks, in now close to 100 countries, greater transparency in government budgets and greater government accountability for the effective use of scarce public resources.</p><p>The financial support IBP provides goes to a diverse group of organizations. Some, such as Fundar in Mexico or Ibase in Brazil highly capable CSOs that use budget analysis in pursuit of broad national-level policy goals. Others, such as HakiElimu in Tanzania and the Omar Asghar Khan Foundation in Pakistan, got their start with a focus on a single sector and have gradually expanded their work from that foundation.</p><p>Major Donors:</p><p>Ford Foundation</p><p>Open Society Institute</p><p>William and Flora Hewlett Foundation <a id=\"Major_Projects\" name=\"Major_Projects\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects</h2><p>Open Budget Survey 2010 The Open Budget Survey is the only independent, comparative, and regular measure of budget transparency and accountability around the world. The 2010 Survey finds that 74 of the 94 countries assessed fail to meet basic standards of precision and accountability with national budgets. This opens the door to abuse and inappropriate and inefficient use of public money. However, the 2010 Survey also reveals that improvement can, and has happened, in a relatively short time period and in some of most challenging contexts. <a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-IBP-0\">\u2191 <a href=\"#cite_ref-IBP_0-0\" title=\"\">1.0</a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-IBP_0-1\" title=\"\">1.1</a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-IBP_0-2\" title=\"\">1.2</a> [ <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.internationalbudget.org/who-we-are/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.internationalbudget.org/who-we-are/\">http://www.internationalbudget.org/who-we-are/</a> International Budget Partnership (Who We Are)]</li><li id=\"cite_note-CBPP-1\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-CBPP_1-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.cbpp.org/\">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a></li><li id=\"cite_note-Funding-2\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-Funding_2-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.internationalbudget.org/files/who-we-are/annual-report-2009.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.internationalbudget.org/files/who-we-are/annual-report-2009.pdf\">International Budget Partnership (Funding)</a></li></ol><p><a id=\"Secondary_Sources\" name=\"Secondary_Sources\"></a></p><h2>Secondary Sources</h2><p>Child Friendly Budgets for 2010 and Beyond - <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Global_Economic_Crisis_Cambodia.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Global_Economic_Crisis_Cambodia.pdf\">http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Global_Economic_Crisis_Cambodia.pdf</a></p><p>\"Fiscal Transparency - Self-Evaluation Report.\" IMF -- International Monetary Fund Home Page.

For elementary schools, the councils consist of eleven members who are one principal, six parent representatives, two community representatives, and two teacher representatives. [1] For high schools, and councils consist of twelve members which are the principal, six parent representatives, two community representatives, two teacher representatives, and one student representative. However, in high school councils, the student representative is not allowed to vote on personnel matters such as contractual agreements, evaluation retention, principal selection, and the allocation of teaching and staff resources.</p><p>School-Based Budget</p><p>LSCs help develop and approve a school budget, with major control over an average of $500,000 per year in flexible funds from the state. [2] <a id=\"Member_Eligibility\" name=\"Member_Eligibility\"></a></p><h2>Member Eligibility</h2><p>In order to be a member of a Chicago Local School Council (LSC), you must be either a parent or community member of the schools and fill out an application. The members are elected or nominated by parents and community residence in an election that takes place every two years. [1] The applications that future members are required to fill out, call for them to include basic information such as name, date of birth, address and how many children of theirs attending the school; as well as their children\u2019s birth date and classroom. Candidates are also required to have two forms of identification and show their economic interests; such as if they are related to the principal and if they or any family member or relatives do business with the school. This is done at the time in which they are applying to be a member of the council. This shows if the applicant may have any outside interest in becoming a member aside from improving the schools.</p><p>Further description of what qualifies candidates to be eligible for these positions is given.</p><p>Principal</p><p>-The Principal, whether contractual, acting, or interim, is automatically a member of their school\u2019s LSC.</p><p>Parent representative</p><p>A parent representative is eligible to serve on an LSC if he/she:</p><p>-Is the parent or legal guardian of a child currently enrolled in that school; and</p><p>-is not an employee of the Board. [1]</p><p>Community representative</p><p>A community representative is eligible to serve on an LSC if he/she:</p><p>-Resides in the attendance area or voting district of that school.</p><p>-Does not have a child currently enrolled at that school and is not an employee of the Board. [1]</p><p>Teacher representative</p><p>A teacher representative is eligible to serve on an LSC if he/she:</p><p>-Is employed and assigned in a teaching position or in a position for which qualifications as a teacher are required; and</p><p>-is employed to perform the majority of his/her employment duties at the attendance center. [1]</p><p>Student representative</p><p>A student representative is eligible to serve on the LSC if he/she is a full-time high school student. [1] Additional LSC information</p><p>-Relatives of the principal are ineligible to serve on the LSC.</p><p>-Individuals who have been convicted of certain felony crimes are ineligible to serve, either indefinitely or for 10 years after the date of conviction.</p><p>-Appointed or elected LSC members may be seated immediately with FULL LSC voting privileges pending the completion of their criminal background checks. [1] <a id=\"Meeting_Structure\" name=\"Meeting_Structure\"></a></p><h2>Meeting Structure</h2><p>Most LSCs meet monthly, and the date, time, and location of these meetings posted.</p><p>One great part of these meetings is that they are open to the public. This allows parents, teachers, students, and community members who are not part of the councils to at least be informed of what is happening within their schools. This is a great aspect of the organization in relation to deliberation because, again, it allows for a wide variety of opinions and views. This also creates a space where the attending public to make comments about the topics at hand. Also, comments from people in attendance can provide other solutions that the council members may not have previously thought of. The public can voice their opinions of what their main concerns are as well. This feature of the council contributes to the social aspect of deliberation because all people in attendance have an opportunity to give their thoughts and concerns, and it allows people to consider the ideas and experiences of others.</p><p>Not all meetings however, are open to the public. These closed meetings are ones that discuss matters along the lines of personnel, discipline issues, and safety.</p><p>The LSCs are required to hold at least two meetings that are open to the public specifically to present and discuss the annual school improvement plan, proposals to the budget, and present a report on the progress of the school and students. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>In 1988 the Chicago School Reform Act passed, which created the Local School Councils, as well as sub district councils, School Board Nominating Commission, and Mayor-appointed interim board. The first election for the first Local School Council was held in October of 1989. 17,256 people ran, 312,000 voted, and 6,000 members were elected to serve. [1] Since then, the LSC voting process was declared unconstitutional in 1990 due to the suspicion of corrupt council members; thus a new election process was created and altered throughout the years. In 1995 a new requirement was implemented in which incoming LSC members were required to take three days of training. This was to make sure each member knew their duty and what they would be deliberating on. In 1996 the CPS acquired the ability to set criteria for principal positions. Three years later in 1999, the CPS system was restructured, and LSC members would have to go through criminal background checks, and members no longer had to file Statement of Economic Interest with Cook County. [1] Today, LSCs meetings are taken very seriously and its members do the best they can for their local schools. <a id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2><p>The LSC meets on a regular basis discussing the hire of their school\u2019s principal on a four-year performance contract, set priorities for school improvement, and determine the school\u2019s budget. The typical LSC meets monthly and nearly always has a quorum. The average parent or community LSC member devotes 28 hours per month to helping their school. [2] To build on the strengths of Chicago\u2019s LSCs and overcome weaknesses, those committed to the Chicago schools have taken major actions to change the ways in which LSCs are currently treated and educated: Central office staff had been interfering inappropriately in LSC decision making, often pursuing their own political agendas. LSCs and their supporters have included a wider variety of people to stop these abuses and build LSCs capability. The process for educating and assisting LSCs is used to stop the violation of widely recognized standards for effective adult education. [2]</p><p>Now the LSC has a number of instructional learning sessions required for local school council members. These sessions are used to enhance their knowledge of how LSCs operate and their role as a LSC member. [1] An 18 hour training program must be completed with in six months of a council member taking office. The Board is in charge of monitoring this training, and if an LSC member fails to complete the required program with in the designated six month time period, the Board will declare his or her position vacant. The LSC will then appoint a qualified person who meets the eligibility requirements to fill the unexpired term. [1]</p><p>There are six mandatory lessons (12 hours) that LSC members have to take. The additional 3 lessons can come from a variety of topics approved by the Board. The six mandatory lessons are: [1]</p><p>\u2022 Roles and Responsibilities as Policy Makers</p><p>\u2022 Effective Local School Councils</p><p>\u2022 School Improvement Planning for Advancing Academic Achievement</p><p>\u2022 Budget</p><p>\u2022 Principal Performance Evaluation</p><p>\u2022 Principal Retention and Principal Selection</p><p>The process of teaching those who are in the council contributes the making the council more deliberative a whole. This creates a strong information base for the members and allows the council to perform to the best of their ability. Once the council members have gone through the mandatory sessions within the six month period, council members are able to make the best decisions possible for the local schools. <a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>Local School Councils are run by faculty, staff, parents and students. These are all people who are there strictly to make a difference in their local schools and not for profit. Being volunteers, there is no organized funding for this organization. The LSCs are a representation of those involved in Chicago\u2019s local school districts. <a id=\"Analysis_and_Critique\" name=\"Analysis_and_Critique\"></a></p><h2>Analysis and Critique</h2><p>In this section there will be statements showing how the Chicago LSCs are doing well portraying a deliberative process. There will also be critiques and suggestions stating how the Chicago LSCs are not ideally deliberative and how a council could improve.</p><p>Analysis</p><p>There are several ways that the Chicago LSCs are deliberative. First, it allows for differing points of view from community members, parents, principals, teachers, and at the high school level, students as well. The restrictions on eligibility are necessary to have in place so that only people, who have the ability to make an impact on local schools, are the ones who have a direct connection with the schools. Whether they live in the area of one of the schools, they are an employee of the school, or are a parent of a student attending the school, or students themselves, they can make a difference. The ability for such a variety of people to become involved with these LSCs is also a strong point in the deliberative process, as it allows for lots of different and contrasting viewpoints. Not only older, more experienced members of the public, but the youth that actually attend the schools (high schools) can be elected and have a voice as well.</p><p>This also allows the members to identify a broad range of solutions to the issues that the councils deal with, such as budget allocation and future planning. Teachers who have been in the education system have seen where budgeting has gone and can have a great input on where it needs to go. Students can also chime in to where they would like to see their schools budget go and what their peers would participate in or enjoy having in their school. Parents can make suggestions on what they may or may not want their kids being influenced by where the budget is being spent. Citizens in the area can voice their opinions on what improvements they may want to see in the local schools. Principals are also important for regulating what planning solutions are actually plausible. This group together, can come up with a variety of solutions and make the best decision possible for that particular location.</p><p>Local School Council members are now more educated in the job that they are carrying out. Because everyone that enters the council takes the same required classes there is less room for misunderstanding during deliberation. This requirement ensures that there is mutual comprehension between members, yet there is still a variety of ideas and experiences.</p><p>Critique</p><p>An improvement that could be made to make this organization more deliberative would be to open it up to more members. As of now, only council participation number maxes out at eleven members for elementary schools and twelve members for high schools. The restrictions on eligibility could remain the same, as to keep those who are relevant in the running. However, adding more members could also provide more viewpoints, allowing the councils to come to even more educated, well rounded, and beneficial decisions on the issues. Currently, high school LSCs are restricted to only twelve members, one of which is a student at the school. While the variety of members is a great resource, more members in general could provide an even greater benefit for the organization; especially more students and teachers. These are the people who have the first hand experience of what goes on in the school and know what needs improvement. Similarly, schools below the high school level are currently only allowed eleven members; none of which are students. Allowing more input from parents, teachers, and community members could provide a great benefit to the organization.</p><p>At this point LSCs are run by volunteers and thus are a nonprofit organization. Although a high percentage of LSCs are up and running smoothly, 4% of Chicago\u2019s LSCs are practically inactive and 13% are very inconsistent with actually performing their most basic responsibilities. [2] This creates for a very unsuccessful or nonexistent deliberative process. If there were some sort of system put in place to make people want to volunteer there would be more people volunteering in these low functioning councils. If a rule were put in place that made there be a new council member in each spot (beside teachers and the principal) every tow years, instead of just another election. The rule would provide a wider variety of people that would have to volunteer and there would be a greater turnover in member volunteering. This would give new people a chance to make a difference in the local school system and discourage unethical behavior from taking place. With new members comes a new wave of fresh ideas and more experiences; a better deliberative process. <a id=\"Publications\" name=\"Publications\"></a></p><h2>Publications</h2><p><a id=\"Extra_Links\" name=\"Extra_Links\"></a></p><h2>Extra Links</h2><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_School_Councils\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_School_Councils\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_School_Councils</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Chicago_Public_Schools\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Chicago_Public_Schools\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Chicago_Public_Schools</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://piccolo.cps.k12.il.us/local_school_council.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://piccolo.cps.k12.il.us/local_school_council.htm\">http://piccolo.cps.k12.il.us/local_school_council.htm</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.edline.net/pages/Whitney_M_Young_Magnet_HS/-Parent_Group/Local_School_Council\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.edline.net/pages/Whitney_M_Young_Magnet_HS/-Parent_Group/Local_School_Council\">http://www.edline.net/pages/Whitney_M_Young_Magnet_HS/-Parent_Group/Local_School_Council</a> <a id=\"Secondary_Sources\" name=\"Secondary_Sources\"></a></p><h2>Secondary Sources</h2><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.Designforchange.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.Designforchange.org\">http://www.Designforchange.org</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/index.php\">http://www.catalyst-chicago.org/index.php</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/backtalk/2010/03/your_local_school_council_need.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/backtalk/2010/03/your_local_school_council_need.html\">http://blogs.suntimes.com/backtalk/2010/03/your_local_school_council_need.html</a> <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://austintalks.org/2010/11/douglass-local-school-council-members-brace-for-change/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://austintalks.org/2010/11/douglass-local-school-council-members-brace-for-change/\">http://austintalks.org/2010/11/douglass-local-school-council-members-brace-for-change/</a> <a id=\"Notes\" name=\"Notes\"></a></p><h2>Notes</h2><p><a id=\"Bibliography\" name=\"Bibliography\"></a></p><h2>Bibliography</h2><p>[1] Chicago Public Schools. \"Chicago Public Schools: Local School Councils.\" Chicago Public Schools: Home. 2010.

They are concerned with what the citizens in our country are concerned with, and in turn focus on these issues. A question that has driven their research today is: \u201cWhat does it take to make democracy work as it should?\u201d They focus on the importance of citizens taking an active role to make political practices more deliberative. Their research is unique because it really puts people in the forefront. They strive to explore what people can do to address different problems in their community and also at a national level. There are three hypotheses, which are used in all of Kettering\u2019s research. These hypotheses state that democracy requires: \u201cCitizens who as \u201csovereigns\u201d can make sound decisions about public issues.\u201d \u201cCitizens who can act together to deal with their problems beginning in their communities.\u201d \u201cCitizens who can align the work they do with the institutions they created to serve them so that civic initiatives reinforce institutional efforts.\u201d</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation\">http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation</a></p><p>Purpose</p><p>The Kettering Foundation is run on continuing to uncover more information through different aspects of research. There are six different research programs, which they work on conjointly to help ensure that democracy is working, as it should. These programs draw from the experiences of citizens in our country when they are able to get involved and work within their communities The six programs are: Citizens and Public Choice, Community Politics, Public-Public Education, Public-Government Relationship, Institutions And Professions In The Public Realm and Multinational Research. The first program is based on citizens and public choice. They look at how citizens can make a collective actions and decisions with sound judgment, which ensures a more deliberative process. Kettering feels that people will be more inclined to take accountability for decisions that they make on their own. The Kettering foundation spreads the word by issuing books on different issues; people can then use these books as resources so they can make more deliberative decisions on different issues. The next program focuses on all of the aspects of community politics. This ranges from how to address problems as citizens and also how to make decisions on different issues in the community. They really put an emphasis on the importance of citizen involvement in the community. There is another program that researches public-to-public education. This research really displays the importance of citizens taking responsibility and ownership of the education we offer our children. The next research program is based on the public to government relationship. Many citizens looking from the outside sometimes feel that the political system is driven by special interests from the government. The relationship between the citizens and government are examined and the research also sees if the work of government can support their work to the citizens. Kettering also has a research program, which examines how institutions and professions can connect to the citizens in a democratic way. It dwells into how the practices of institutions and professions can support the citizens in a more democratic fashion. They also contribute by doing multinational research; they are able to work with many countries. They spend time learning from people around the world about their own personal feelings on their own individual governments. The research also tries to discover how people feel that their country should be run; in what they believe to be is more democratic.</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kettering.org/foundation_programs\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org/foundation_programs\">http://www.kettering.org/foundation_programs</a></p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h1>History</h1><p>The foundation is named after Charles Kettering and was founded in 1927 \"to sponsor and carry out scientific research for the benefit of humanity.\" The American born Charles F. Kettering founded Kettering based on his positive outlook and thinking. It was built on his inspiration and philosophical approach. Today, the foundation has increased the scope of research to many different areas like improving democracy and education. During the 1960\u2019s many new areas of concern were brought up and used for research. These concerns included improving public education and the relationship with the government and public. One of the most important projects the foundation began to work on was called the Institute for Development of Educational Activities, Inc. The purpose was to improve education so that the younger generations could receive a better way of being taught. One of the most important events involved with this was the Dartmouth Conferences, \u201ca series of high level discussions between prominent citizens of the U.S. and USSR, which the foundation began to cosponsor in 1969.\u201d The foundation went private in the 1970\u2019s and decided to operate in a different manner. There was a change in how the foundation was run and this was from the idea that the foundation would stop making grants. The foundation decided it would be a better idea to perform research on its own. They began to focus their research on areas such as: \u201ceducation, urban affairs, science and technology, and international relations.\u201d The evidence which the foundation is uncovering is that the issues in our world have more connection to resolutions that stem from practices in a social sense. They have begun to realize that many problems we face aren\u2019t necessarily in need of new age technology; rather that they can be faced through politics. This again, draws what the foundation really cares about, and this is the citizen. Kettering is researching the ways in which the individual can get involved and help improve democracy in the world.</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/history\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/history\">http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/history</a></p><p><a id=\"Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Projects_and_Events\"></a></p><h1>Projects and Events</h1><p>The Kettering foundation\u2019s focus on education and research is represented in the types of projects the foundation undertakes. The foundation produces periodicals, collaborates with other institutions such as the National Issues Forums, and sponsors numerous publications that aim at informing the public of relevant national issues.</p><p>Many institutions have used of the research that the Kettering Foundation has conducted. The foundation has had the opportunity to conduct experiments in the state of Hawaii. This research was initiated by the legislature who wanted a group at the university to research the information that is available how citizens evaluate issues in a deliberative matter before the general assembly. This research is crucial because it evaluates the reasoning citizens have when evaluating issues. The government can also understand what it is that is important to citizens and how they will evaluate issues when they do arise.</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kettering.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org\">http://www.kettering.org</a></p><p><a id=\"Periodicals\" name=\"Periodicals\"></a></p><h2>Periodicals</h2><p>There are three annual periodicals that the Kettering Foundation produces and distributes:</p><p>Connections is an annual newsletter that focuses on one specific program area that the Foundation finds important. Editing of the newsletter rotates among the Kettering Foundation staff. This allows for the information and viewpoints to change and the influences printed in the letter to never be monopolized by one view. The contents of each newsletter include book reviews, articles and stories pertaining to the focus discussion.</p><p>The Kettering Review is a periodical dedicated to improving American public life and democracy. This publication presents ideas and activities aimed at starting public discussion and initiating large-scale involvement in civic deliberation. The Kettering Foundation explains that, each issue addresses a single theme, including the changing roles of the citizen, the press, public leadership, and public opinion. Contributors include a diverse group of American and international educators, historians, philosophers, and social and political scientists.</p><p>The Higher Education Exchange is a periodical that focuses on ways that students and instructors can start and keep ongoing discussions about public life. The Foundation found inspiration for the periodical in the following quote by Thomas Jefferson, \u201cI know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education.\u201d The foundation believes that the purpose of higher education is to provide students with a foundation for living a productive and successful public life. This includes a definitive understanding of democracy and how deliberation improves not only democratic ideals but civic life also.</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kettering.org/media_room\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org/media_room\">http://www.kettering.org/media_room</a></p><p><a id=\"Specialization\" name=\"Specialization\"></a></p><h1>Specialization</h1><p>The Kettering Foundation stands out because of their unique research in which the conduct. They want their research to be focused from the eyes of citizens. This means they are primarily concerned with how people evaluate issues and what can be done. Kettering promotes the advancement of democracy in hopes to make it a better system for citizens. They hope to see that people can make a change at a micro-level, in terms of being involved in their own communities.</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/what_we_do\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/what_we_do\">http://www.kettering.org/about_the_foundation/what_we_do</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h1>Funding</h1><p>The Kettering Foundation was originally funded by a private endowment from Charles F.

The funding for the foundation currently estimated at $270 million is invested in many assets. These investments provide funding for the research programs and interests the Kettering Foundation sponsors. Also the foundation\u2019s annual budget is reflective of the market and the current net worth of the company\u2019s assets and investments.</p><p>Some examples of other organizations the Kettering foundation collaborates with both financially and through research are: The Harwood Institute for Public Innovation, International Civil Society Consortium, International Institute For Sustained Dialogue, National Issues Forums Institute, Public Agenda, and Sustained Dialogue Campus Network.

The first being Citizens who as \u201csovereigns\u201d can make sound decisions about public issues, the second: Citizens who can act together to deal with their problems, beginning in their communities, and lastly: Citizens who can align the work they do with the institutions they created to serve them so that civic initiatives reinforce institutional efforts (Kettering Foundation Website). These three \u201chypothesizes\u201d are all viable to expect a deliberative community to function. This foundation is one that focuses not on implementing deliberation, rather researches how deliberation can become more affective in our communities from the citizens\u2019 perspective. The Kettering Foundation follows the \u201cThree Criteria for the Democratic Process\u201d (Gastil, PCD, 2008) which are inclusion, participation opportunities, and enlightened understanding. Inclusion is attained by researching not only governmental examples of deliberation, but the educational system and how to maintain deliberation in schools. Participation opportunities are achieved not only on the employment level but participating in studies as well. The Kettering Foundation provides many possibilities for people of different backgrounds to participate in their studies and provide input as to how deliberation can be accomplished. Foundation programs range from public programs on education and community politics to multinational research where deliberation is evaluated overseas. In terms of enlightened understanding the goal to learn how to study issues and reflect carefully on their values, is reached by results that the Kettering Foundation posts to the citizens\u2019. These findings that are discovered through their research are published to the public through various types of media such as research reports, books, occasional papers, and videos posted on this Web site; The Kettering Review, The Higher Education Exchange, and Connections are examples of research findings that The Kettering Foundation places into periodicals. The guides and publications that are produced by this large foundation are not only used by officially sponsored events, but by local community organizers as well (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf\">http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf</a>). Information published in these guides is available to the general public, making sure that each person has an equal opportunity to understand how to accomplish correct deliberation.</p><p>The National Issues Forums has been a central figure in terms of attaining deliberation. This discussion program that has been a milestone for decades has been a key partner with the Kettering Foundation. The partnership that has developed between these two organizations has created remarkable improvements of reaching the deliberation standards. There is a massive amount of positivity being conveyed from many organizations and people about the Kettering Foundation and the NIF working together, \u201cThe National Issues Forums, with the encouragement of the Kettering Foundation, has refined and enriched the discussion group methodology\u201d (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.viewpointlearning.org/publications/articles/kettering_fall06.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.viewpointlearning.org/publications/articles/kettering_fall06.pdf\">http://www.viewpointlearning.org/publications/articles/kettering_fall06.pdf</a>). The next event will take place in spring of 2011; the two organizations collaborated to create a program to address economic security on the national, state, and local level (nifi.org). The effectiveness of the Kettering Foundation on increasing the quality of deliberation is noticed by the largest organizations worldwide, that is why they are constantly in demand of other organizations. A second example of the guide being used was when discussing the term \u201cachievement gap\u201d and evaluating the context and meaning of the phrase. The guide was able to allow diverse participants to talk openly about the issue and eventually the participants were able to find common ground and work through strategies of improvement to be implemented to the connotation of the phrase \u201cachievement gap\u201d (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf\">http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf</a>). Kettering Foundation is able to achieve deliberation not only through organizations and events that are sponsored by them, but by producing these useful guides. These guides are extremely constructive and very deliberative as they direct citizens how to facilitate meetings.</p><p>Overall the Kettering Foundation is at one of the highest levels possible in terms of promoting deliberation. This promotion of deliberation is not just to community members, but to government officials as well. The guides that are produced are utilized by many different markets of people; therefore their spread of the concept, deliberation, is vital to continue to allow deliberation to grow. The organization as a whole is promoting deliberation at the highest level possible. The Kettering Foundation does not only focus on government, but education, communities, and race as well, reaching a very wide market of people. The Kettering Foundation is an organization that is noticed by many of the top professionals in the deliberation field.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Secondary_Sources\" name=\"Secondary_Sources\"></a></p><h1>Secondary Sources</h1><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf\">http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED510122.pdf</a> = (Flono, Fannie. 2010.

Overseen by OpenDemocracy.net and its advisory board (yet edited and conducted by an independent panel with relevant expertise to the region), the organization incorporates news, blogs, and opinions from a broad spectrum of sources and intellectual camps onto the oD Russia website, with the aim of fostering a platform for more comprehensive information gathering, value orienting, and deliberation to occur for those who are otherwise only exposed to less deliberative media sources on the relevant topics in the region. More elegantly stated by oD Russia\u2019s founder editors Susan Richards and Zygmunt Dzieciolowski, \u201copenDemocracy Russia offers a thoughtful platform for people concerned about the future of Russia and her desire to establish a new place in the world.\u201d (1)</p><p><a id=\"Media_Contributors\" name=\"Media_Contributors\"></a></p><h2>Media Contributors</h2><p>oD Russia utilizes a number of main stream news sources, as well as more marginalized opinion sources, when compiling the totality of its presented media. Of particular note is the Moscow ezine polit.ru, for which oD Russia claims is \u201dat the core of openDemocracy Russia's offering[s]\u201d (1). However, oD Russia also has distributing partnerships with openspace.ru, an internet magazine dedicated to Russian culture, and the Levada Center, a Russian survey research group which conducts regular polls on all aspects of Russian life. Among the list of individual contributors to the website include Floriana Fossato, \u201ca former Moscow correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u201d, Maria Lipman, a \u201cfellow of the Carnegie Moscow Centre\u201d, Andrei Zorin, \u201ca professor of Russian and Fellow of New College, Oxford\u201d, and a much more extensive list of various authors, journalists, and academics who volunteer their work on a list consistent basis. (1)</p><p><a id=\"Specializations_and_Activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_Activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and Activities</h2><p>Among the topics for which oD Russia reports on are \u201cconflict, culture, economy, environment, foreign, history, human rights, internal, law and order, media, politics, and religion\u201d (1). Users are able to either utilize the main page\u2019s \u201cfront page,\u201d which displays the most viewed and promoted topics for the day, or search for news and opinion under the specific sections listed above. Also available is the option to search region-specifically, including sections for news and opinion under Abkhazia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan (1). Of particular note is oD Russia\u2019s recognition of Abkhazia as a legitimized nation, an otherwise controversial question of legitimacy, as the region is only recognized by Russia, Nicaraugua, Venezuela, Naura, and the unrecognized national entities of South Ossetia and Transnistria (2). News and opinion are reported under of these sections from a wide spectrum of sources and opinions, often times presenting both sides of an issues arguments, with the ability for users to then comment and continue the discussion using the websites comment forum. oD Russia also has a Facebook fan group and Twitter account, allowing for users to integrate the oD Russia media and deliberation into their social networks. Finally, oD Russia contributes to the printed publishing\u2019s of the openDemocracy network, for which a notable portion of the entirety of the openDemocracy budget is derived.</p><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>oD Russia\u2019s funding comes from the general openDemocracy budget. According to the OpenDemocracy website, \u201c[half of the grants are] for special projects and sections \u2026 including oD Russia\u201d (3). Of the $823,675 which makes up the entirety of openDemocracy\u2019s annual budget, 87% comes from special grants. The 2010 major contributors to the openDemocracy and editorial projects included: The Barrow Cadbury Trust,The Charles E Chadwyck-Healey Charitable Trust, David &amp; Elaine Potter Charitable Foundation, Hivos, The Open Society Institute, The Open Trust, The Tedworth Charitable Trust, Heinrich Boell Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust,and John Jackson (3). The maximum amount from these grants directly contributed to oD Russia and its project execution is $716,597. However, oD Russia also has access to the rest of the openDemocracy budget, which is derived from reader donations, books and publications, and advertising and republishing, at 5%, 6%, and 2% respectively (3). Most of the books and publications proceeds come from the openDemocracy Amazon.com store section, for which \u201call purchases from [the store section] and any search on Amazon starting [there] earn\u2019s OPENDEMOCRACY referral fees\u201d (4). Reader donations are made available at multiple junctions through-out both the openDemocracy main site and the oD Russia site alike. The advertising and republishing appears to result largely out of the republishing and information sharing partnership oD Russia has with polit.ru.</p><p><a id=\"Role_and_Context_in_Russian_Media_Climate\" name=\"Role_and_Context_in_Russian_Media_Climate\"></a></p><h2>Role and Context in Russian Media Climate</h2><p>oD Russia plays a unique role in the media climate of Russia. Unlike other western nations, the media in Russia and the post-Soviet region is largely regulated and concentrated, although admittedly not to the extent that occurred during the Soviet period. Like other industries that went through privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union, the media in the region was quickly re-centralized into the hands of elite former party members, parties, and business\u2019 oligarchs due to the process of voucher privatization. Telecommunications was not even fully de-nationalized until late in the 1990\u2019s. During this period, acquisition of media holdings became increasingly important, as \u201cthe role of the [emerging parties] was determined by media holdings\u201d (5) This climate resulted in the current media environment, where in Vladimir Putin and the United Russia political party has implemented drastic restrictions on the ability of news outlets to report on all political matters, and the total number of news sources available to the public pales in comparison to similar Western nations (5).</p><p>Further, the lack of progress Russian news publishers have made in utilizing new media channels, such as the internet, compared to world news sources is of particular note. Due to lack of infrastructure, a majority of Russians are still without high-speed internet access in their homes. As such, the motivation for producing Russo-centric news, and there by taking advantage of the internet\u2019s deliberative advantage, is lacking. Still, even that news which is made available on the internet is more often than not simply the replication of paper sources. One estimate places the figure for the percentage of all internet media being simple replications of paper sources at about 70% (5).</p><p>oD Russia is unique in the Russian media market in that it focuses on obtaining multiple opinions and input on given topics and that it is almost strictly an online news source, encouraging users to engage the topic discussions actively. The ability to not only publish dissenting opinions on otherwise uniform Russian opinion/official Kremlin position, but as well voice unadulterated support for these positions, makes oD Russia a unique media platform in the Russian media environment. Ultimately, it is these qualities which make this otherwise un-noteworthy online news source impactful and critical to the landscape of its target audience.</p><p><a id=\"Evaluation_of_Deliberative_Quality\" name=\"Evaluation_of_Deliberative_Quality\"></a></p><h2>Evaluation of Deliberative Quality</h2><p>In evaluating oD Russia\u2019s deliberative quality, Dr. John Gastil\u2019s five analytical criteria for deliberation are utilized, those being: providing a solid information base, prioritizing values, brainstorming a broad range of solutions, weighing pros and cons, and finally making the best decision possible (6). oD Russia excels considerably in the first two steps of establishing information and orienting values. Considering the fact that most Russians gain their news from only one two sources, oD Russia\u2019s emphasis on covering a multiplicity of different types of stories, especially those not being covered anywhere else, contributes greatly to the ability of its users to deliberate further. Similarly, oD Russia excels greatly in helping users orient their values further by compiling opinions and editorials from multiple different ideological camps on the stories being covered. In doing so, users of oD Russia become more acquainted with different thought and analytical patterns, helping them establish an opinion and ideology to utilize in further discussion. The other three deliberative steps are emphasized to a lesser extent by oD Russia. While the website offers a forum for users to comment on the stories and editorials they read, the platform is not set up in a Socratic format, but rather a narrative one. Conceivably, users are able to engage in direct discussion on the website, although admittedly this is not the primary mission or purpose of program. Rather, oD Russia is a tool for which to help otherwise uninformed Russians begin the process of establishing the knowledge and values to engage in deliberation through other mediums. Especially considering the media environment of Russia and the post-Soviet region, oD Russia\u2019s simple contribution and aim of allowing for a more democratic and deliberative civil society to flourish is commendable. While the platform is not directly a deliberative one, its value as a tool to the people of the region is unparalleled.</p><p><a id=\"Online_Sources\" name=\"Online_Sources\"></a></p><h2>Online Sources</h2><p>1.) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/russia/russia_about\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/russia/russia_about\">http://www.opendemocracy.net/russia/russia_about</a></p><p>2.) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6233&amp;Itemid=65\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6233&amp;Itemid=65\">http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6233&amp;Itemid=65</a></p><p>3.) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/info/opendemocracy-financial-summary-2009\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/info/opendemocracy-financial-summary-2009\">http://www.opendemocracy.net/info/opendemocracy-financial-summary-2009</a></p><p>4.) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://astore.amazon.co.uk/opendemocra0e-21\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://astore.amazon.co.uk/opendemocra0e-21\">http://astore.amazon.co.uk/opendemocra0e-21</a></p><p><a id=\"Secondary_Literature\" name=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a></p><h2>Secondary Literature</h2><p>5.)

In recent years, private sectors, NGOs and NPOs have been increasing their involvement in the Farmer-Group Approach. Maximizing the agricultural outputs is very important in Kenya because the economy, its development and the GDP of Kenya heavily rely on its agricultural outputs. As a part of the agricultural extension services, the Government created the National Agricultural Extension Policy (NASEP). The Governmental branch since the late 1990\u2019s has encouraged farmers to interact with each other while sharing knowledge, resources and experiences by using the Farmer-Group approach. An ideal farmer group would maintain the number of its members between twenty and thirty. Farmer groups have no facilitators or specific structure of how these meetings are supposed to be run. Although it can be argued that such lack of deliberate structure for these groups could eventually result in giving participant-farmers more freedoms to speak out and share their knowledge, resources, and experiences, surveys have shown over time that it has been a weakness for the strategy. Nonetheless, since the introduction of Farmer Groups, the agriculture in Kenya has been making a steady improvement. <a id=\"1._Purpose_of_Farmer_Groups\" name=\"1._Purpose_of_Farmer_Groups\"></a></p><h2>1. Purpose of Farmer Groups</h2><p>Since the independence from the United Kingdom in 1963, the economic focus in Kenya has been the agricultural improvement and the achieving of its self-sufficiency. It was first understood by the Government that industrialization cannot be reached without the strong agricultural basis. Agriculture to Kenya and its economic development was the most important thing because of a different reason as well. The reason was that the long British colonization era in Kenya made its economy very one dimensional due to the fact that the Brits made the whole Kenya one big farming land. Therefore, the only economic option for Kenyans was to pursuit the economic development through the development of its agriculture. In that light, farmer groups are used to provide farmers in all of Kenya with updated technologies, information and methods. Extension officers are often present at these meetings to take notes of these meetings. These notes are presented to the government officials so that they could take these opinions in consideration when making policies. <a id=\"2._Background_and_History\" name=\"2._Background_and_History\"></a></p><h2>2. Background and History</h2><p>The independence from the Great Britain left then the newly born Kenya unable to function in many aspects including governance, politics, sociology, and more. Its economy was not an exception. The most apparent negative consequence of the British colonization was that the Economy of Kenya was left one dimensional. The agricultural production was practically the only thing Kenya could offer economically in the 1960\u2019s. The lack of other economic means forced the Kenyan Government to highly rely on its agricultural outputs and as a method to maximize the outputs by incorporating newly developed technologies, they used baraza (in literal translation baraza means village gathering) to mobilize these agricultural communities. <a id=\"3._Problems_of_Baraza\" name=\"3._Problems_of_Baraza\"></a></p><h2>3. Problems of Baraza</h2><p>The main problem of these barazas was the fact that it was a complete top-down method. Baraza can trace its roots back to traditional tribal meetings in which tribal leaders would talk and common villagers (just men, women were often excluded) would just listen and follow whatever they were told. Now in these modern village gatherings called barazas, these old traditions continued. According to the observation notes provided by Dr. Catherine Wawasi Kitetu, on the average baraza lasted two to four hours and within these two to four hours, activities of extension officers who were like those tribal leaders consisted of talking, lecturing, describing and explaining while activities of farmers who could be seen as common villagers were listening and thanking.</p><p>Such a traditional top-down approach of community mobilizing did not meet the expectations previously set by the Kenyan Authorities. In next couple of decades, the Government would try other approaches to maximize the agricultural outputs by spreading new technologies and newly developed and improved agricultural methods.</p><p>Other problems also occurred as time went on. One of the more significant problems was the exclusion of female farmers in these baraza gatherings. Data has shown that the 75% of labour in the Kenyan agriculture was done by women and according to the report provided by Dr. Kitetu, only a handful of female farmers were observed by her at baraza. <a id=\"4._The_introduction_of_Farmer_Groups\" name=\"4._The_introduction_of_Farmer_Groups\"></a></p><h2>4. The introduction of Farmer Groups</h2><p>The method was first brought up and introduced as the replacement for the Baraza approach which the Government had been taking since its independence in the early sixties and in the end was proven ineffective in improving the status, the out puts and the culture of the agriculture of Kenya. In response the failure of such top-down methods, the newly introduced Farmer Group Approach encouraged horizontal methods which encouraged individual farmers to come together to talk about problems and reach consensus, conclusions and solutions. <a id=\"5._Structure_of_Farmer_Groups\" name=\"5._Structure_of_Farmer_Groups\"></a></p><h2>5. Structure of Farmer Groups</h2><p>The very first thing to be understood is that the participation is completely voluntary for farmer groups. While these group meetings are generally seen as beneficial, farmers have and do practice their rights whether to participate or not. Some farmer groups have set bars of membership requirements so that not all farmers could join the group.</p><p>Unlike the structure of baraza, the basic structure of farmer groups was made possible for participants to see each other as equals. For example, at barazas extensions officers were seated at a table placed on a higher ground so that they were looking down on villagers. It was seen as sign of their superiority. These officers were only ones speaking at these gatherings and all others were there to just listen and observe. At farmer group meetings, however, all tables are placed on the same level of ground and everyone is free to voice their opinions. Although extension officers are often present at these gatherings, officers are not there to dominate the meetings but to contribute and provide information before the meeting. They also take notes for future policy making.</p><p>In these meetings which usually last about thirty minutes to an hour, there are three big phases. In the opening phase, house keeping things are informed. In the key part of these meetings, the second phase of farmer group meetings, extension officials share technologies and individual farmers share knowledge and experiences to make things better for all who serve in the agricultural industry. It is not uncommon to have group \u201cleaders\u201d present at these meetings, but their title does not give them any extra power as their extra duty is not to facilitate but just to make sure things do not get out of hand. Group meetings are run freely and without a specific structure. In the third and the final phase of the group meetings, they review what they have talked about so far in the meeting and adjure.</p><p>The most important difference between baraza and farmer group approaches is the roles of participants. Extension officers\u2019 primary duties at baraza were to provide all the information or simply put, to talk while duties of the same people at farmer group meetings are to listen and take notes with occasional presentation of updated technologies and methods. Farmers\u2019 primary duties at baraza were to listen. However, at group meetings, they were the main participants who share, question and talk about problems and development of agriculture in Kenya. <a id=\"6._Problems_of_Farmer_Groups\" name=\"6._Problems_of_Farmer_Groups\"></a></p><h2>6. Problems of Farmer Groups</h2><p>The lack of detailed structure of these meetings have given participants unlimited freedom to voice their opinions. But it also has caused problems of inefficiencies. There have been records of participants getting off the topic during meetings. Scholars have warned about the lack of structure and what it would mean in a long run for the extension program.</p><p>The allocation of the financial resources has also caused a significant amount of problems against the development and frequent usage of the method. In the early 2000's, the Kenyan Government has made a tremendous decrease in funds for these approach. Since private sectors have taken up the role of providing resources for these farmer groups. But since these funds come in as investments for these farmers, less profitable areas and rural areas have not gotten the same about of attention or resources. NGOs and local NPOs have tried to provided for these less profitable districts in Kenya but their resources are also limited. <a id=\"7._Effects\" name=\"7._Effects\"></a></p><h2>7. Effects</h2><p>Farmer groups, though much improved from baraza, are not perfect to say the least. But there have been a number of positive reports about the Farmer Group Approach. The Kyeko Self Help Farmer Group has reportedly helped a significant number of women which saw a dramatic increase in their outputs in just one year; from $2,000 in 2001 to $14,000 in 2002 or from 1,985kg in 2001 to 19,800kg of outputs in 2002. Although the case of the Kyeko Self Help Farmer Group is a very successful case which stands out among others, the general consensus is that the Farmer-Group approach has improved the overall quality of the agricultural industry in Kenya but there is a lot of room for it to grow. <a id=\"8._References\" name=\"8._References\"></a></p><h2>8.

The overarching objective from DEMO-net.org is to strengthen scientific, technological and social research excellence in eParticipation by integrating the research capacities of individuals and organizations spread across Europe. A more detailed definition of e-participation is \"the use of information and communication technologies to broaden and deepen political participation by enabling citizens to connect with one another and with their elected representatives\" (Macintosh 2004). This research will help coordinate the framework involved in eParticipitation by connecting leading European organizations to pool together research regarding current political practices. \n</p>\n\n<a name=\"Purpose_and_Mission\" id=\"Purpose_and_Mission\"></a><h2>Purpose and Mission</h2>\n<p>The main issues covered in this research focus on the lack of involvement with current politics. This organization wishes to develop tools that will help promote political involvement by integrating current research with eParticipation. DEMO-net plans on advancing the research involved by achieving active citizenship and reducing voter disinterest. DEMO-net puts together research information and resources for hundreds of people to use. Pages include resources for practitioners, researchers and PhD students. There is also a page that allows for practitioner stakeholders to engage in eParticipation. With all resources given to participants, the programme is designed to pool together all information pertaining to the lack of citizen interest with politics. In order to fulfill all goals set forth by the European Council, DEMO-net has established three high-level research objectives. These objectives are:\n</p><p>Objective 1: Establish a large amount of easily accessible material relating to the research and information regarding eParticipation that will be helpful for European policy making. 1.1 Acquire research information provided from a wide variety of viewpoints in order to view opposing objectives. 1.2 Use relevant sources that will provide evidence to support solid decision making for both policy-makers and practitioners. \n</p><p>Objective 2: Investigate what is responsible for limiting eParticipation across Europe. 2.1 Analyze conversational techniques to discover what needs to be done and what alliances need to be build at different levels. 2.2 Research future and current eParticipation technological infrastructures and methods. \n</p><p>Objective 3: Develop a set of criteria that can be easily adopted by future eParticipation initiatives across Europe. 3.1 Design a way for concepts and terminologies to be organized from both academic disciplines involved and non-academic stakeholders.\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>DEMO-net started up Janurary 1, 2006. It was created by the European Commision\u2019s sixth framework programme as one of the Network of excellence research projects and is expected to run for four years. The European Commission comes from one of the five key institutions created in the supranatural European Union community system. The proposal for commission came from Robert Schuman, a French Minister on May 9th, 1950. The first commission that originated in 1951 was the nine member \u201chigh authority.\u201d Two communities were added in 1958 with the Treaties of Rome. These three bodies existed as the European executives until July 1st, 1967 when the Merger Treaty was signed. Currently the Commission is comprised of a college of Commissioners. There are 27 members total including the President and vice-presidents. They are responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and general running of the Union. Under the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty on October 2nd, 1997, conducting research institutions and implementing European research programmes became an obligation. With this, The Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development were revised to receive more funding than when the Framework Programmes began in 1984. The Sixth Framework Programme was the beginning of funding for the creation of DEMO-net. It was started up as one of the Programme\u2019s Network of Excellence research projects. This Programme\u2019s main objective was to contribute to the European Research Area. DEMO-net was then designed to help with research regarding eParticipation and the lack of citizen involvement in current politics. The current project coordinator is Professor Ann Macintosh from the Institute of Communications Studies at the University of Leeds in Leeds, United Kingdom. Since it\u2019s founding in 2006, DEMO-net has been able to host over 100 events and continues to research eParticipation with roughly 727 active users.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Specializations_and_Activities\" id=\"Specializations_and_Activities\"></a><h2>Specializations and Activities</h2>\n<p>Four different strategies are integrated into DEMO-net activities. These strategies include:\n</p><p>1. Integration Activities- The integration activities are designed to bring together many varying research topics from all over Europe. The goal is to strengthen national Centers of Excellence by allowing research to be gained from differing disciplinary boundaries. Activities that took place were researcher integration, workshops between institutions, PhD student seminars, exchange programs for students, student field studies, and the creation of a European eParticiparion portal. Each of these activities took place in different workpackages, or WPs. There were a total of 12 for integration. \n</p><p>2. Joint Research Activities- This programme was designed to bring together 12 diverse areas to provide a common platform for research. It focused its ideas on issues regarding the community and excellence in European eParticipation. Some activities include: gap analysis and roadmapping, study of eParticipation tools and methods, communication analysis, vital communities, evaluation methods, and emerging standards and business models. This consisted of 14 different workpackages all focusing on different activities.\n</p><p>3. Spreading of Excellence- Ensures that the Network of Excellence is the main focus between all connecting networks to generate knowledge to stakeholders and decision-makers while collecting important feedback to contribute to the network\u2019s research agenda. The spreading of excellence activities include: community and partnership building, sustainable innovation methods within public sector, regional and national seminars for eParticipation decision making, publication of all research, and conferences and seminars. \n</p><p>4. Network Management- Ensures professional management of the network by evaluation of risk management and careful planning by creating a management technical infrastructure. Activities include: financial coordination, planning and control of activities, risk assessment and project evaluations. The goal is to ensure a high quality of management in the network.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2>\n<p>DEMO-net is organized to provide many events covering various countries in Europe. It offers the support to build a solid structural system in order to mobilize researchers around Europe and strengthens the connection between academics and government organizations. There are 19 head partners involved in DEMO-net with multiple locations across Europe. Hundreds of practitioners, researchers, and PhD students are also involved in contributing to the research. In order for successful research between differing demographics, many different types of events must occur. Since it started in 2006, DEMO-net archives list 123 events to have taken place. Among these events are committee meetings, many international conferences regarding topics such as voting and eDemocracy, online deliberations, seminars, workshops, networking sessions, colloquiums, symposiums, and forums. The council of Europe forum for future of democracy is an event contributing to debates regarding research information. DEMO-net also features the eGovernment days. The 8th annual was held in Prague in April, 2010. This event provides a solid platform for the exchange of diverse and creative ideas between European countries. It also inspires technology transfer between eastern and western Europe. <a href=\"http://www.demo-net.org\">www.demo-net.org</a> provides a map and information for all upcoming events.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>DEMO-net is funded under the European Commission's sixth framework programme: Information Society Technologies IS. The sixth framework programme (FP6) is one of seven framework programmes set up by the European Union to fund research and technological development for European advancement. The European Union provides funding for the Framework Programmes with the idea that they will provide a high investment return in the future. Putting money into research will help the European economy in years to come. The overall budget for the Sixth Framework Programme during the four year period from 3003-2006 was \u20ac17.5 billion. DEMO-net was given a four year budget of \u20ac6 million starting on January 1, 2006 leaving them with a $1.9 million U.S. annual budget. The seventh Framework Programme is currently in place and will run until 2013 with a budget of \u20ac51 billion.\n</p>\n<a name=\"References\" id=\"References\"></a><h2>References</h2>\n<p>1.\"The eParticipation Network of Excellence.\" DEMO-net.org.

It all began in the fall of 2006 when a group of three, then eventually seven organizers started having meetings and exchanging ideas about the problems in American public life. They formulated ideas on \u201cfixing disengaged citizenry, public dissatisfaction with partisan politics, an increasingly polarized public in which people move into ideological camps rather than see common solutions, persistent disparities bases on social identity and class, disturbing limitations to civil liberties, and academic freedom and environmental stability on campuses.\u201d</p><p>The original group of The Democracy Imperative created their Statement of Principles and Practices, and revised it in 2007 and 2009. They currently welcome suggestions and encourage the use of their own Statement of Principles and Practices in other group discussion forums as a standard of democracy.</p><p>Since 2007 The Democracy Imperative has grown to nearly 450 members, from all disciplines, institutions and programs around the nation. They maintain an open source website so that materials are available to the masses. <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>Syllabi Repository</p><p>The Democracy Imperative maintains a syllabi repository. \u201cThey request syllabi or detailed descriptions that describe courses and programs in deliberative democracy, inclusive dialogue, public reasoning and deliberation, community conflict resolution, and citizen participation in public decision and policy-making.\u201d This is so that courses and programs throughout the nation can supplement their classes and also contribute material to the website.</p><p>Catalyst Papers</p><p>TDI asks colleges and universities to consider how they support teaching and learning for democracy, the Catalyst Papers initiative is designed to help campuses break that task down into manageable parts by asking, what can be done on campus within specific academic programs and activities.</p><p>Constitution Day\u2028</p><p>Currently, their UNH intern is collecting links and resources for campuses interested in bolstering their Constitution Day activities.

However, due to economic hardships the program is currently unfunded. The Democracy Imperative also currently works as a community and practice, and is grateful for its website and technical support from the University of New Hampshire that it is still providing. Due to this predicament, it is open to organization or foundations that are looking for a program to sponsor. Membership is still free and open to members around the nation. <a id=\"Major_Projects\" name=\"Major_Projects\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects</h2><p>Notable Projects: 2009 National Conference, Workshops, Projects, Working Groups, and Institutional Support.</p><p>2009 National Conference Organized by both The Democracy Imperative and the Deliberative Democracy Consortium, the 2009 National Conference was instituted on the need to discuss and deliberate the challenges and changes facing democracy in America. At this conference, members noted that campuses nationally had an increased interest in politics and a trend towards deliberative methods of democracy. They strove to understand what methods were effective and popular among student bases.</p><p>Workshops</p><p>The Democracy Imperative currently offers three workshops that they can visit college campus and teach. Those are: \u201cAn Introduction to Models of Inclusive Dialogue, Public Deliberation, and Deliberative Democracy on Campuses, An Introduction to Models of Inclusive Dialogue, Public Deliberation, and Deliberative Democracy on Campuses, Democratic Teaching Methods.\u201d The purpose of these workshops is to educate students, staff, and faculty about different deliberative methods so that they can implement them on their respective campuses.</p><p>Projects</p><p>Projects are contributions to the website by members and the The Democracy Imperative\u2019s Board. These can come in the form of syllabi, papers, bibliography additions, and comments. The Democracy Imperative Welcomes all comments, suggestions, and contributions, and maintains open access to all information it generates and receives.</p><p>Working Groups</p><p>Working groups are comprised of members from The Democracy Imperative and are informal meeting groups of people who share a common interest or concern and wish to discuss and improve the issue. These informal groups are open to all, and members are encouraged to join already established working groups to contribute and interact with members. Some working groups have a physical location, such as a university classroom, and other working groups choose to participate entirely online. Online workshops are done in private forums, Wiki spaces, and other forms of online interaction.</p><p>Institutional Support</p><p>The Democracy Imperative recognizes the difficulty in implementing a deliberative democracy, and is there to support institutions that need help bringing deliberation to their community or campus. TDI seeks to aid in resources and provide information so that individuals searching to develop a deliberative environment can attain the education and assistance they need to do so. <a id=\"Secondary_Literature\" name=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a></p><h2>Secondary Literature</h2><p>Journal of Public Deliberation <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=jpd\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=jpd\">http://services.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=jpd</a></p><p>Leading in the UNH community: Achieving common goals through shared leadership <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/catalyst-paper2_20071116.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/catalyst-paper2_20071116.pdf\">http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/catalyst-paper2_20071116.pdf</a></p><p>Shared Governance Literature <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.csus.edu/ccp/publications/Shared_Governance_in_Higher_Education_-_April_2008.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.csus.edu/ccp/publications/Shared_Governance_in_Higher_Education_-_April_2008.pdf\">http://www.csus.edu/ccp/publications/Shared_Governance_in_Higher_Education_-_April_2008.pdf</a></p><p>Journal of College and Character <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://journals.naspa.org/jcc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://journals.naspa.org/jcc/\">http://journals.naspa.org/jcc/</a> U.K. Government Report on People Power <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/communitiesincontrol\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/communitiesincontrol\">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/communitiesincontrol</a></p><p>Venues For Democratic Leadership and Decision Making <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_democratic-governance.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_democratic-governance.pdf\">http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_democratic-governance.pdf</a></p><p>Venues for Teaching and Learning Deliberative Democracy <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_teaching-learning.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_teaching-learning.pdf\">http://www.unh.edu/democracy/pdf/venues_teaching-learning.pdf</a> <a id=\"Links\" name=\"Links\"></a></p><h2>Links</h2><p>AACU resources on civic learning <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.aacu.org/resources/civicengagement/index.cfm?utm_source=pubs&amp;utm_medium=blast&amp;utm_campaign=ccresppub\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.aacu.org/resources/civicengagement/index.cfm?utm_source=pubs&amp;utm_medium=blast&amp;utm_campaign=ccresppub\">http://www.aacu.org/resources/civicengagement/index.cfm?utm_source=pubs&amp;utm_medium=blast&amp;utm_campaign=ccresppub</a></p><p>The Deliberative Democracy Consortium (DDC) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.deliberative-democracy.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.deliberative-democracy.net/\">http://www.deliberative-democracy.net/</a></p><p>Everyday Democracy (Previously the Study Circles Resource Center) <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.everyday-democracy.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.everyday-democracy.org\">http://www.everyday-democracy.org</a></p><p>American Associations of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)\u2028American Democracy Project <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.aascu.org/programs/adp\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.aascu.org/programs/adp\">http://www.aascu.org/programs/adp</a>.</p><p>Campus Compact <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.compact.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.compact.org\">http://www.compact.org</a></p><p>Higher Education Network for Civic Engagement (HENCE)\"\" <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.henceonline.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.henceonline.org/\">http://www.henceonline.org/</a></p><p>Democratic Theory &amp; Practice Database <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.refworks.com/refshare/?site=015251129878000000/RWWS1AA583513/027431162392817000\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.refworks.com/refshare/?site=015251129878000000/RWWS1AA583513/027431162392817000\">http://www.refworks.com/refshare/?site=015251129878000000/RWWS1AA583513/027431162392817000</a> <a id=\"Please_Note\" name=\"Please_Note\"></a></p><h2>Please Note</h2><p>For all quotes in this entry please refer to the website and citation below.

This organization uses Deliberative Polling\u00ae to research about democracy and public opinion. The Center for Deliberative Democracy strives to make the general public more aware of public issues in order to make their decisions more deliberative.</p><p>Citizens of the United States are often uninformed about important public issues. Conventional polls represent the public\u2019s initial impressions of headlines and audio clips. Deliberative Polling\u00ae is an attempt to use both television and public opinion research in a new and productive way. The polling process reveals the conclusions the public would reach, if people were more informed and more involved by the public issues.</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>The Center for Deliberative Democracy was established at Stanford University in 2003, where it currently conducts the research and practice of deliberative polling. Previously, the center was under the name Center for Deliberative Polling and was located at the University of Texas at Austin, where Professor James Fishkin, the current director of the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford, served as director.</p><p>Director and founder of the Center for Deliberative Democracy James Fishkin developed the concept of Deliberative Polling in 1988 in response to the somewhat surprising effects of mass media on public opinion and knowledge. Early communications scholars, such as Marshall McLuhan, envisioned a world where advances in communicatory technologies such as print and radio would create a \u201cglobal village,\u201d where the public would be connected and informed on public policies and issues from all sides, including those that are least favorable to the individual, so that one may make a truly informed decision. Instead, mass media has caused the public to seek out media with views in which they agree with and to be more focused on entertainment value of media, dwindling campaigns to merely slogans and attack ads. Deliberative Polling was Fishkin\u2019s institutional answer to how to make the public more informed through scientifically sampling of citizens, three to four days of deliberation on public policies, and proper polling methods to have an end result of a more accurate public opinion. Essentially, deliberative polling is meant to show how the public would feel about public policies and issues if they were better informed and were able to discuss the issues on both the pro and con side of the argument.</p><p>Professor James Fishkin has been working on his concept of Deliberative Polling for over twenty years throughout the U.S and various countries in the world, with the Center for Deliberative Democracy as the center for the research and practice of this method. The center has conducted over twenty -two research experiments throughout the U.S and other countries including China.</p><p><a id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a></p><h2>Major Projects and Events</h2><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/hard-times-hard-choices-michigan-citizens-deliberate\">Hard Times, Hard Choices: Michigan Citizens Deliberate</a>: The \u201cHard Times, Hard Choices\u201d program is a By the People (BTP) civic engagement initiative started by MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, working in partnership with the Center for Deliberative Democracy (CDD) at Stanford University. BTP works to bring the views of informed citizens into the discussion of the important issues of today. Since its origins in 2002, BTP has supported over 200 Resident Deliberations around the country and more than 100 national and local PBS broadcasts. The deliberations and broadcasts dealt with issues such as national security, healthcare, and education. BTP received a grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation for this Michigan-based project \u201cHard Times, Hard Choices.\u201d The Kellogg Foundation invested nearly $50 million in Michigan this year, all toward improving lives for children in need. On November 13-15, 2009, a random representative sample of more than 300 Michigan residents engaged in a face-to-face statewide Deliberative Poll centered around key issues related to the state\u2019s economy and budget choices leading up to the 2010 election. The participants convened in Lansing, Michigan. The event moderator was Kwame Holman, the correspondent for The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. Michigan Public Television Stations, including WDCQ-TV Delta College, Detroit Public TV, WCMU, and WKAR, participated through community outreach projects, which engaged local communities through further discussions.</p><p>Taxes: Michigan residents confronted the budget crisis and the demands on scarce state resources. They moved strongly to support increases in certain taxes and decreases in others. They also increased their willingness to pay for essential services. The taxes the residents were willing to increase were the ones involving sales and income taxes. The taxes they moved to cut concerned the stimulation of new jobs. Their final deliberative views on taxes are strikingly different from \u201ctop of the head\u201d conventional polls. Support for increasing the sales tax went up by fourteen points from 37% to 51%. Support for increasing the income tax went up by 18 points from 27% to 45%. Support for increasing the beer and wine tax was high before and after deliberation (increasing from 66 to 68%). However, support for cutting the business tax rose by 27 points from 40% to 67%. \u201cSupplying tax incentives for companies to move to Michigan\u201d had high levels of support both before and after (moving only from 74% to 78%). After the deliberation Michigan participants were interested in the tax cuts that might stimulate jobs but they were willing to accept the burden of tax increases that might help the state\u2019s difficult finances.</p><p>The Environment: Another important result of the Michigan citizen\u2019s deliberation was the consistent focus of the participants on the environment. The green economy and environmental concerns went up significantly in the post-deliberation results. For example, results for increasing incentives for businesses to produce green products and services went up from 60% to 75%.</p><p>Michigan\u2019s Economic Future: The participants were asked about various policy directions the state government could concentrate on in building Michigan\u2019s economic future. Overall, there was the most support for \u201cmaking Michigan a knowledge/high tech economy\u201d (74% before deliberation, 81% after). After the deliberation, all the options had strong support but none predominated. The participants didn\u2019t reach an agreed upon solution.</p><p>Volunteering: Some questions were also asked about whether \u201cthe efforts of volunteers working outside government\u201d could lead to significant improvements. When asked about education, the percentage believing volunteers could help a great deal rose from 73% to 81%, for \u201cservices to those in need\u201d the percentage rose from 77% to 84%, and for the environment the percentage rose from 70% to 81%. In other areas like job training, skill level of the workforce, and healthcare a strong majority agreed that volunteers could improve these areas.</p><p>Knowledge: The Michigan residents were asked five factual knowledge questions and six party placement knowledge questions related to the topics discussed. Most of the questions showed statistically large increases over the course of the deliberation. The overall knowledge index for all the knowledge questions increased from 38% before the deliberation to 46% after the citizens\u2019 deliberation.</p><p>Deliberative Polling Evaluation: The participants were asked to evaluate the components of the deliberation. Overall, the residents gave it significantly high scores. The entire process was rated valuable by 83%, the small group discussions by 89%, \u201cmeeting and talking to other delegates outside the group discussions\u201d by 83%, the large sessions by 75%. 76% of the participants agreed \u201cmy group moderator provided the opportunity for everyone to participate in the discussion.\u201d 63% agreed that \u201cthe members of my group participated relatively equally in the discussions.\u201d 85% disagreed that \u201cmy group moderator sometimes tried to influence the group with his or her own views.\u201d 53% agreed, \u201cmy group moderator tried to make sure that opposing arguments were considered.\u201d And 57% agreed \u201cI learned a lot about people very different from me\u2014about what they and their lives are like.\u201d</p><p>Deliberative Polling\u00ae: California</p><dl><dd>San Mateo Countywide Assembly on Housing Choices</dd></dl><p>This study looks at what should be done if there is a critical housing shortage in San Mateo County. It was funded by Threshold 2008, which is civic group working to engage the public about housing issues in efforts to have better long-term quality of life for people affected by housing choices. They strongly believe in the deliberative process and the education of citizens so they can make better decisions. A Deliberative Poll\u00ae was taken of scientific sample of the counties residents. It was conducted over a weekend with a sample of 238 residents that looked at competing policy options. They became more informed about these policy options and questioned competing experts. At the end of the weekend some even changed their views. The Deliberative Poll\u00ae was held by Ca\u00f1ada College on March 15-16, 2008.</p><dl><dd>Policy Attitudes</dd></dl><p>Coming in to this project only 38% of the people thought there was a need for more housing in the county. There was a surprising change in vies by the end of the weekend, with the percentage supporting that there was a need for more housing had risen to 68%. Before the weekend 61% of residents thought new housing should be located in already developed areas, but after it increased to 72%. Before deliberation the percentage that wanted to minimize the number of commuters even if it means less job growth, went from 25% to 35%. Also people believing that developers should be required to have a certain fraction of their homes below the market rate went from 59% to 74%. There was also an increase with participants wanting both more public consultation and regional authority in housing decisions. Economically the participants more so believed that new housing development would increase the economic vitality of the region, as well as new housing development being good for the environment. There was an increase of 22 points with people believing that if there were no new housing development companies would move away. They also became more concerned with people that do the county\u2019s vital services like police, fire, education, and health would suffer if there is a continuation of a shortage of affordable housing.</p><dl><dd>Representativeness</dd></dl><p>There were 1,594 non-participants who were resident who took the survey, but did not participate, and 238 in the scientific random sample of deliberators. Participants and non-participants are relatively similar. The group for the weekend deliberation represented most demographic factors, though a modest difference in age, income and education. Gender, race, and ethnicity were similar between non-participants and participants. Between the non-participants and participants only two of the policy question appeared with any statistically significant differences.</p><dl><dd>Knowledge Gains</dd></dl><p>With an index of eight knowledge questions, people being able to answer the questions correctly went from 13% to 28%, a 15 point gain which is statistically significant. This sample became much more informed about housing issues. Only around 3 percent knew the median price of a single family home before deliberation, and rose the 19% after. Another drastic percentage increase from 26% TO 58% took place with participants who could correctly answer the approximate percentage of households that could afford a median priced home.</p><dl><dd>Evaluation</dd></dl><p>The evaluation of this event found that participants thought it to be quite worthwhile with 65% giving it a perfect 10 rating where 0 was \u201ca waste of time\u201d and a 10 was \u201cextremely valuable,\u201d and 95% said it was \u201cvaluable.\u201d For the small group discussions the ratings were very similar, with 1% lower on each factor. The plenary sessions with the experts had the people rating it as 85% \u201cvaluable\u201d and 47% gave them a perfect 10. 81% agreed that, \u201cMy small group moderator tried to make sure that opposing arguments were considered,\u201d and 94% that \u201cmy small group moderator provided the opportunity for everyone to participate in the discussion. By engaging with people from so many different backgrounds the participants seemed to learn a lot. 85% ended up agreeing that, \u201cI learned a lot about people very different from me\u2014what they and their lives are like.\u201d</p><dl><dd>Method</dd></dl><p>The Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford was used by Threshold 2008 to conduct this event. Professor James Fishkin and Robert Luskin participated in coming up with the design of this public consultation. James Fishkin commented about how the process helped the San Mateo County be put in a room to think about some difficult choices. IT helped them become more informed and help things become clear in their conclusions. He hopes policy makers pay attention because it is a public voice with a representative sampling that shows what people think when they thoroughly consider competing arguments and become informed.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Energy Choices: Vermont's Energy Future</p><p>The Deliberative Poll was taken to Vermont in November of 2007 to address the future energy requirements of the state of Vermont and how to best achieve the sufficient amount of energy for the state. The Poll began with 154 people, and for various reasons by the end of the process, 146 people could be used for the data research. The Deliberative Poll aims to mainly clarify the participants policy attitudes, their empirical premises, and values and how these change pre and post deliberation. The procedures of the Deliberative Poll include the initial polling of a random sample of Vermont inhabitants to have a base idea on public views on the issue, a weekend of deliberation for recruited Vermonters on the various ways Vermont could tackle the issue of energy, and a follow-up questionnaire at the end of the deliberative weekend. The deliberation days were facilitated by moderators who were trained by Professor Fishkin as part of the CDD.</p><p>Issue Briefing</p><p>The contracts providing more that sixty percent of Vermont\u2019s electricity are set to expire in the year 2012, leaving the people of Vermont open to discuss and examine where the future source or sources of Vermont\u2019s electricity should be from. There were three main options for how Vermont should best handle its\u2019 energy requirements. The first would be the amount of reliance the state should have on energy efficiency and alternative forms of energy such as wind, nuclear, and hydro. The second would be the reliance on energy that the state had currently been purchasing from suppliers such as Vermont Yankee and Hydro Quebec. Lastly, how much reliance the state should place on a small number of large central facilities or into many smaller and more distributed facilities</p><p>Deliberative Polling Results</p><p>Following the deliberation days in which the participants could weigh the pros and cons of each of the state\u2019s options and discuss among each other, the Deliberative Poll showed to have a fairly statistical significance in changing the participants opinions on the best tactics for the state to use concerning its\u2019 energy usage.</p><p>We see a 20% increase in support for the continuation of purchasing energy from Quebec Hydro, and an 8% increase with the continuation with Independent Power contracts. With the option of continuing to buy from Vermont Yankee nuclear plant however, the percentages did not change significantly for or against.</p><p>Percentages of participants interest in using hydro and wood as an energy source increased, while we see a decrease in the percentages for the interest in using coal and oil for energy.</p><p>There is an increase in support for energy efficiency to the best of the State\u2019s abilities rather than buying or generating power.</p><p>Knowledge</p><p>The deliberation portion of the deliberative polling done in Vermont also brought about changes in participants\u2019 knowledge of actual facts concerning energy sources and alternate energy sources and how these empirical premises shape the participants opinion. We can see how the difference in knowledge prior to deliberation and knowledge post deliberation may explain why the participants voted in certain ways as outlined above.</p><p>The majority of participants felt that power not received from Hydro-Quebec or from Vermont Yankee would not need to be covered by natural gas, coal, out of state nuclear, or oil, and we see an increase in this belief after deliberation processes</p><p>Over the next 10 years, participant\u2019s felt that an efficient use of Vermont\u2019s electricity could reduce the state\u2019s need by an average of 22%, where after deliberation, we see that that belief declines by 9%</p><p>Wood and methane energy was previously viewed to be less friendly than wind and solar power, but was later found to be significantly friendlier to the environment while oil, coal, and natural gas were found to be significantly unfriendlier than previously thought.</p><p>Participant's Evaluation</p><p>On a scale from 0 to 10, the selected Vermonters were asked to rate the value of the deliberative poll to them, 0 being absolutely non-valuable, and 10 being of great value to their lives. The average rating of the amount of value was a 9.16, with 68% rating the experience as a full 10, and 90% giving it at least an 8. The value of the small group discussions during the deliberation weekend received a similar rating of an average of 9.08 with 66% giving a full 10, and 90% giving at least an 8. The last question was to rate the value of the conversations outside the formal discussions with other participants was slightly less, with an average of 7.99, with 42% giving the perfect 10 and 64% with at least an 8.</p><p>Most importantly with deliberation is the chance to learn people\u2019s views that may differ from one\u2019s own views so as to make the individual a more informed person and able to weigh all sides of an issue. The participants were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with the following statement, \u201cI learned a lot about people very different from me \u2013 about what they and their lives are like.\u201d 67% of the participants agreed with the statement with 36% who agreed strongly, and only 12% of the participants who disagreed.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Deliberative Polling\u00ae: American Democracy Project</p><dl><dd>American Association of State Colleges and Universites:\u2028Deliberative Polling\u00ae Project</dd></dl><p>This study looks into how Deliberative Polling\u00ae could be used to engage students, staff, faculty, and/or members of the larger community in discussions of public concern on college campuses. Would it create a more informed community with becoming better at the democratic processes and prepare undergraduates to be engaged and informed citizens? 16 AASCU have been invited to have 1 to 2 representatives be apart of a Deliberative Polling\u00ae Training Institute co-sponsored by The New York Times and the Center for Deliberative Democracy. This study hopes the schools will institute deliberative polling initiatives at their campuses after taking part in this process.</p><p>The institutions in 2008 and 2009 hosted Deliberative Polls\u00ae on their campuses and for 2010 the third Deliberative Polling Institute will take place at the ADP National Meeting. It will have two models of Deliberative Polls\u00ae, the first maintaining the integrity of the social science when conducting a statistically significant poll. The second model will include discussion group facilitators, panels of leading experts, issue-based dialogue, but not the strict and sometimes expensive social science requirements to having a representative sample.</p><p>List of Participants</p><ul><li><ul><li>Austin Peay State University</li><li>California State University Fullerton</li><li>California University of Pennsylvania</li><li>Emporia State University</li><li>Fitchburg State College</li><li>Florida Gulf Coast University</li><li>Fort Hays State University</li><li>Indiana University</li><li>Purdue University Indianapolis</li><li>Lincoln University of Missouri</li><li>Metropolitan State University</li><li>Northern Kentucky University</li><li>Plattsburgh State University of New York</li><li>State University of New York College at Cortland</li><li>The Richard Stockton College Of New Jersey</li><li>Towson University</li><li>Troy State University</li><li>University of Alaska-Anchorage</li><li>University Of Illinois At Springfield</li><li>University of Maine Augusta</li><li>University of Nebraska at Omaha</li><li>University of Tennessee Martin</li><li>University-Central Oklahoma</li><li>Weber State University</li><li>West Chester University</li><li>Western Carolina University</li><li>Western Connecticut State University</li><li>Western Kentucky University</li><li>Winona State University</li></ul></li></ul><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>The Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford has received funding for an assortment of research and projects through various contributors.

In addition, it fosters the participation of people around the continent in order to support and benefit the citizens of the African Union, promote incorporation of key African Union policy standards into national law by state and non-state figures, and lastly to encourage policies and programs that entail good social, political, economic, and cultural practices. The process of the CCP-AU encourages joint collaboration, research, discussion, and deliberation among participants and others in the African Union, therefore contributing to all the above key purposes. The CCP-AU believes in the inclusion of all African voices, and a citizenship that is underpinned with transparency and accountability. The CCP-AU believes that a successful country is one strengthened by the participation of its citizens, ultimately achieving collaborative development of the country. \n</p><p>The following is a list of the key objectives for the CCP-AU:\n</p><p>1.       To enhance African Civil Society Organizations\u2019 (CSOs) awareness and knowledge of the African Union\u2019s objectives and working procedures and provide up-to-date information of its activities\n2.       To serve as a link between African CSOs and the AU in enabling CSOs to access the Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO) and the Economic Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), the official organ for CSO participation in the African Union;\n3.       To organize, conduct and coordinate Continental CSO Conferences in the lead up to the AU\u2019s bi-annual summits with the view to enhance meaningful participation of African CSOs and generate a communiqu\u00e9 to enable CSOs to lobby Heads of States on AU Summit agenda issues;\n4.       To lobby and advocate the African Union member states to adopt agreements, protocols and other similar legal instruments that promote political, economical, social and cultural progress of African countries;\n5.       To advocate for the domestication of such adopted instruments into State parties\u2019 legal system and policy framework according to local legislations;\n6.       To raise, mobilize and disburse funds and other resources to enable African CSOs to participate in Continental CSO Conferences organized by the Centre.\n</p><p>The CCP-AU achieves it\u2019s key objectives through a number of strategies, including training workshops on the structures and functions of the African Union, collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs) to brainstorm new policies, supplying CSOs and other stakeholders with detailed and timely updates on the activities of the African Union through its website and listserv, as well as holding biannual Citizens\u2019 Continental Conferences. The latter allows delegates from all around the continent the ability to deliberate on issues of common concern, and subsequently relay concrete recommendations to the Heads of State and Government meetings.\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h1>History</h1>\n<p>\tThe CCP-AU began in 2007, originally with the intention of facilitating and creating the participation of CSOs and encouraging a clear understanding amongst citizens of the African Union, including its key functions and decision making processes. The CCP-AU has two office locations, one in Nairobi and another in Addis, however they are aspiring to have four locations very soon. The two current offices work with the African Union Commission, the AU Judicial Organs, and the NEPAD/APRM; its three main focal organizations. The CCP-AU began in order to allow discussion and deliberation amongst citizens and CSOs about five main themes prevalent to current concerns within the continent. The five themes are listed below:\n</p><p>\u2022\tAfrican Union Government and Regional Integration\n\u2022\tDemocracy, Governance, Human Rights and Leadership\n\u2022\tEconomic Justice\n\u2022\tGender Equality and Women\u2019s Rights\n\u2022\tPeace and Security\n</p><p>Membership and participation in the CCP-AU is open to any organization or interested citizen. Members are encouraged to partake in the CCP-AU in accordance with \u201cthe spirit and letter of the Constitutive Act of the African Union and African Court of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\u201d All organizations seeking to participate should be prepared to enhance and complement the values of the main themes listed previously. In addition, the CCP-AU website (<a href=\"http://www.ccpau.org\">www.ccpau.org</a>) is open to the public for registration. Being a registered member of the website keeps participants and interested citizens updated with news, progress, and developments occurring within the CCP-AU. Furthermore, there is a discussion forum on the website that allows everyone to participate and converse about current affairs, CCP-AU activities/projects, CCP-AU improvements, suggestions, and questions, as well as other general information regarding CSOs in Africa. \n</p>\n<a name=\"Activities\" id=\"Activities\"></a><h1>Activities</h1>\n<p>The CCP-AU\u2019s time and energy is committed to increasing civic participation and transparency within the AU. CCP-AU members attend and participate in annual or bi-annual nongovernmental and governmental meetings concerning policy to help improve the overall enhancement of democracy. In the major projects section below, it is evident that the CCP-AU contributes to the discussion and implementation of advocacy programs. Also, as discussed earlier, the CCP-AU is committed to promoting knowledge among the social, cultural, political and economic concerns in the AU and possible policy solutions. In doing so, the CCP-AU motivates its current and incoming members to attend state or regional events. The CCP-AU in turn provides logistical support to keep its members interested and continuously active in civic engagement. \n</p><p>Since 2007 the CCP-AU has held training workshops for more than 100 representatives of African Citizens and CSO\u2019s to focus on and study the structures of the AU and how to become engaged with it. In addition, the CCP-AU has organized five continental conferences, bringing together over 350 CSO representatives. These continental conferences resulted in the bi-annual summit results, which provided recommendations that were distributed to governmental delegates attending the conferences as well as the media. \n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a><h1>Major Projects and Events</h1>\n<p>The information below is relayed on the CCP-AU website for further inquiry.

The organization allows citizens of the AU to gather and deliberate about issues that need attention or policy amendment. In addition, the CCP-AU attempts to inform and educate the citizens of the continent through their organization techniques and strategies such as sending updates to registered members of the organization, informing the public of decisions being made on key current issues or national affairs. Most importantly, the five main themes prevalent to concerns within the continent are focused on by the CCP-AU, therefore keeping the continents entire well being in consideration. Since the CCP-AU is one of the few organizations supporting citizen participation, its creation has been a crucial stepping-stone for the AU. The CCP-AU has proven to be a highly deliberative organization through its strategies, activities, and major events. \n</p><p>In terms of the analytic processes of deliberation, the CCP-AU has several strong points. Primarily, the CCP-AU has demonstrated to be very thorough at prioritizing key vales at stake. Through its training workshops, conferences, and overall function, the organization is incredibly skilled and equipped in identifying the key public concerns behind the surface facts and events that define an issue. Moreover, the CCP-AU gathers a group of people with a variety of perspectives to carefully examine and deliberate over the most important issues in the African Union, eventually to arrive well reasoned suggestions for improvements. For example, in the conference the CCP-AU organizes bi-annually, equal amounts of people are invited from each of the five regions of the continent in order to ensure diverse viewpoints. In this way the broadest possible range of solutions for solutions to problems are addressed by a large group that may have varying viewpoints. \n</p><p>The CCP-AU also effectively addresses several aspects of the social process for deliberation. For example, the organizations web site makes news and information understandable for readers since each event or publication the CCP-AU is involved with has an external link to more news resources. Also, with the use of diverse sources in their activities and major events (including diverse participants from all different parts of the continent with different backgrounds and perspectives), the CCP-AU reaches beyond conventional debates and discussion. There is therefore time for everyone to seek out other view points and voices in order to arrive at their own personal best decision. \n</p><p>However, there are still a few unclear elements in the CCP-AU. Primarily, the annual budget and how the CCP-AU raises its funding is undisclosed. It is also vague as to how many members are apart of the organization, and their demographic location. Lastly, if the web site was more properly configured with transparent information, then it would be more deliberatively effective. \n</p>\n<a name=\"References\" id=\"References\"></a><h1>References</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ccpau.org/Home/tabid/36/language/en-US/Default.aspx\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ccpau.org/Home/tabid/36/language/en-US/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ccpau.org/Home/tabid/36/language/en-US/Default.aspx</a> \n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Secondary_Literature\" id=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a><h1>Secondary Literature</h1>\n<p>Chitiga, Rudo, Bronwen Manby, and Irungu Houghton.

Independent from the Seattle School District itself, the Alliance works directly with the community and other organizations acting as a junction between the general public and the school district. The mission of the Alliance is to serve as a catalyst for wanted change in the education system based on \u201ca strong belief in the value of public education, the opportunity it brings to every child, and the importance of public education to the health of our whole community.\u201d The organization works behind a self-fulfilling-prophecy idea that raising the bar in education will incite fulfillment of these expectations and benefit all students while further reducing the achievement gap. Five core values guide their process: Accountability to established goals and funders, collaboration with partners, equity for all students\u2019 education, innovation in ideas, and transparency about the outcomes of programs, good or bad. Through its Community Engagement Task Force, the organization provides a space for the local public to express cares and concerns regarding the education system using a community engagement deliberative process.\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Alliance for Education was created in 1995 as a result of robust unhappiness with the Seattle Public School District\u2019s recurring trend of academic decline.  The Seattle Public School District is the largest district in Washington state, educating 45,000 students on an annual budget around half a million dollars (sps.org). However, much of this budget is delegated to every-day maintenance before the school year even begins, leaving the district at a financial loss for any additional improvements or changes made. Combining three education-related organizations into one, the Alliance for Education became \u201ca catalyst for change, a convener of community leadership, and a conduit for directing private resources \u23af both dollars and expertise \u23af toward critical needs in Seattle Public Schools\u201d <a href=\"http://www.alliance4ed.com\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.alliance4ed.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alliance for Education</a> \n\tBeginning with Chief Executive Officer Robin Pasquarella, the organization started off with strong community support and the excited cooperation of Superintendent John Stanford. In 2007, Pasquarella retired and was replaced by Patrick D\u2019Amelio, the former CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Puget Sound. In 2008, Maria Goodloe-Johnson was elected Superintendent of Seattle Public Schools and began the implementation of a five-year strategic plan for better learning. Around this time the organization suffered from a substantial decrease in funding and rumors of bankruptcy were on the horizon. Nonetheless, two new task forces were created in attempts to refocus the Alliance on accountability and collaboration in conjunction with the school district\u2019s five-year plan. These new subdivisions are the Community Engagement Force and Educational Investments Task Force. \n\tSince it\u2019s foundation, the Alliance for Education has directed over $115 million into Seattle Public Schools. Furthermore, the organization has provided leadership training for numerous teachers, School Board members, and administrators while also advocating for the social worth of retaining and rewarding high-quality teachers. Despite financial turmoil in the past three years, the Alliance for Education has remained afloat, continuing to garner the support of the Seattle community and easing the achievement gap to the best of its ability. Current President and CEO, Sara Morris, was appointed in March 2010. <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2003722493&amp;slug=allia\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2003722493&amp;slug=allia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alliance Rights its Ship</a>\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Activities&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Activities (page does not exist)\">Activities</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Activities\" id=\"Activities\"></a><h2>Activities</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alliance4ed.org/ar/documents/AllianceUpdatetotheCommunity.pdf\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.alliance4ed.org/ar/documents/AllianceUpdatetotheCommunity.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">March 2008, Update the Community</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"College_Readiness\" id=\"College_Readiness\"></a><h3> College Readiness </h3>\n<p>One in five Seattle Public School graduates currently meet the requirements to attend a four-year college. <a href=\"http://www.seattleschools.org\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.seattleschools.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seattle Public Schools</a> The Alliance for Education is dedicated to raising the standards of a high school diploma to equate the preparedness necessary for college, the workforce, and life. This challenge requires significant focus on curriculum, course-offerings, and teacher/student support. The organization is working closely with the school district to create a consistent approach to reading, writing, math, science, social studies, and world languages to \u201censure that all students have access to the highest quality content and materials.\u201d It is also taking a direct approach to install more college-preparatory classes into high school by offering more Advanced Placement courses and International Baccalaureate programs as well as distributing the PSAT exam to all 9th, 10th, and 11th, graders to instill a college-bound mentality. In order for any success, the Alliance recognizes the need for increased teacher and student support and is helping the district train more teachers for AP curriculums as well as methods of student support.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Data.2C_Assessment.2C_and_Performance_Management\" id=\"Data.2C_Assessment.2C_and_Performance_Management\"></a><h3> Data, Assessment, and Performance Management </h3>\n<p>Standardized testing like the WASL is useful for monitoring a school\u2019s progress over time but the new data-assessment model, Monitoring Academic Process (MAP), is working to be instilled as a real-time measurer of student performance. MAP assessments are presented three times a school year to in attempts to quickly detect students and school that may be falling behind. Quick detection leads to quick action and better chances of success. The Seattle School District is working to create a new data system for to make such information readily attainable to teaching staff that can then make any necessary altercations to the curriculum in response.

Board members represent various constituencies, making their communication all the more important. As part of the Alliance\u2019s Excellence for All program, grant funding will be provided for the development of school board leaders\u2019 governance, roles and responsibilities, policy, and other necessary areas. Public awareness of the School Board\u2019s work will be discussed and presented in regular meetings with local and national facilitators.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Staff_Development\" id=\"Staff_Development\"></a><h3> Staff Development </h3>\n<p>In the near future, an overhaul of the Seattle Schools District\u2019s human resources team will attempt to gain a wider selection of quality teachers by attracting strong candidates and rewarding the excellence that already exists.

They believe that it is only with full public support and involvement that the challenges facing Seattle schools will be overcome. The Community Engagement Task Force was created as part of the organization\u2019s refocusing plan in 2007. Here, representatives from various communities and organizations meet to discuss issues at hand and create dialogue among the public about possible solutions and ways to get involved. The task force uses the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Community_Dialogue&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Community Dialogue (page does not exist)\">Community Dialogue</a> method of deliberation to achieve a well-rounded and organized discussion between schools and the community. This effort is widely supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  \n</p><p>\u201cThrough our community engagement efforts, we bridge the work of Seattle Public Schools and the communities it serves through constructive dialogue. By engaging the greater community in a thoughtful process, we create opportunities to inspire, inform, listen to, and learn from the collective wisdom of Seattle residents.\" <a href=\"http://www.alliance4ed.org/community/\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.alliance4ed.org/community/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Community_Schools\" id=\"Community_Schools\"></a><h3>Community Schools</h3>\n<p>The Alliance for Educations is involved in research and discussion surrounding a successful new model of public school involvement called Community Schools (CS). CS programs engage participants in a variety of supports to children, youth, parents, and families. Common partners include healthcare, social services, educators, businesses, parents and volunteers, and local organizations. Through this approach, \u201cthe school becomes a center for student, family and neighborhood engagement, a place where school-community connections are built and reinforced\u201d (alliance4ed.com).  Common programs offered include ESL classes, counseling, refugee assistance, tutoring, and pre-school or early learning. \n</p>\n<a name=\"Excellence_for_All\" id=\"Excellence_for_All\"></a><h3>Excellence for All</h3>\n<p>Excellence for All is an umbrella program encompassing numerous areas of the Seattle School District. The plan that focuses on improving student achievement by \u201cproviding students and teachers with the resources they need to succeed, expanding college-ready coursework for students, improving access to student data, and strengthening professional development opportunities for teachers, school leaders, and district officials\u201d (alliance.org). The plan is funded by $9 million grants awarded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, The Boeing Company, and The Stuart Foundation. Excellence for All is meant to support the Seattle School District\u2019s five-year strategic plan for better learning. <a href=\"http://www.seattleschools.org/area/strategicplan/draft/index.dxml\" class=\"external text\" title=\"http://www.seattleschools.org/area/strategicplan/draft/index.dxml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seattle School's Strategic Plan</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Analysis_of_Project_Deliberation\" id=\"Analysis_of_Project_Deliberation\"></a><h3>Analysis of Project Deliberation</h3>\n<p>The Alliance for Education is based on the foundations of successful deliberation. That is, its purpose is to unite the community and school district through dialogue in hopes of creating change. Though every organization must utilize deliberation in order to function, the most active part of the Alliance for Education rests in its Community Engagement force. This portion of the organization is relatively new and still has a lot of progress to make. However, in terms of the definition of deliberation, this task force provides the space necessary to meet such social and analytical needs. That alone is a major step for improving the district-school-community relationship. [Gastil, John]\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>The Alliance for Education relies on private donations from individuals, businesses, and foundations as well as its vast volunteer base. As of 2007, the majority of donations came from individuals closely followed by donations from Boeing and Washington Mutual (J.P. Morgan Chase), as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They also host an annual breakfast and auction. The majority of funds go into data infrastructure, direct school support, and curriculum development with about twenty percent invested in leadership and community building, management, and fundraising.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Philanthropic_Partnership_for_Public_Education_.28PPPE.29\" id=\"Philanthropic_Partnership_for_Public_Education_.28PPPE.29\"></a><h3>Philanthropic Partnership for Public Education (PPPE)</h3>\n<p>This is a group of local funders who support Seattle Public Schools. Members convene four times a year to discuss relevant initiatives and sometimes to join together on a specific project. The group focused on the purposes and usefulness of philanthropies in public schools and Washington State education as a whole. In 2009 the PPPE was responsible for funding audits that helped develop the Excellence for All program.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Educational_Investments\" id=\"Educational_Investments\"></a><h3>Educational Investments</h3>\n<p>The Alliance\u2019s Educational Investments Task Force works hand in hand, first and foremost with the Seattle Public School District, as well as the City of Seattle and higher education. The board works to distribute funds and implement actions into schools in the most beneficial way possible. Before anything is begun, board members conduct pre-investment planning to ensure that everything aligns with the overarching goals of the school district, the funders, and the organization itself. This also consists of prioritizing and pinpointing specific investments that will be most successful and will also fulfill the highest concerns of the public. Furthermore, the Task Force creates a strategic plan for sustainability of the investment as well as specific measurements of its success, which it continues to monitor over time.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Further_reading\" id=\"Further_reading\"></a><h2> Further reading </h2>\n<ul><li>Gastil, John.

The overall objective of DENIVA is to influence poverty reduction policies and related decision-making processes in favor of marginalized groups like women, children, internally displaced persons, HIV/AIDS positive population and persons with disabilities.\n</p>\n\n<a name=\"Purpose_and_Mission\" id=\"Purpose_and_Mission\"></a><h2> Purpose and Mission </h2>\n<p>DENIVA\u2019s purpose is to provide assistance to organizations in forming a civil society that promotes openness, tolerance and responsiveness as basis of a sustainable development in Uganda. According to their website, DENIVA\u2019s mission is \u201cto be a network of indigenous voluntary associations influencing poverty reduction and good governance processes and strategies through mobilizing diverse experiences, knowledge and skills of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Uganda onto a common platform of action\u201d. DENIVA is committed to influence poverty reduction and minority protection policies. Ultimately, DENIVA aims to help build a Ugandan society in there exists equal citizen participation in the national level, decentralizing power from the current semi-authoritarian government. DENIVA\u2019s purpose is to empower member civil society organizations and other groups to achieve democratic growth and sustainable development through networking, advocacy, and capacity building.\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2> History </h2>\n<p>DENIVA was founded by representatives of 21 Ugandan NGOs in 1988. Historically, Uganda has suffered in the hands of authoritarian and oppressive governments. Citizen participation and democratic processes have been essentially foreign to Uganda \u2013 multiparty elections were not introduced until circa 2003. The network was created in an environment where there was civil discontent with centralized government and a call for decentralization of power was taking place. Scholars have classified Ugandan government as a \u201csemi-authoritarian regime\u201d because within its seemingly free and democratic society underlies a tight control of power \u2013 DENIVA can be seen as a large-scale response to governmental activity. Since 1986, organizations oriented in decentralization of power have been gaining space in Uganda \u2013 an advance towards a more deliberative society that sees its political power centralized in President Yoweri Museveni for over 24 years. \n</p><p>DENIVA has been fundamental in protecting non-governmental organizations in Uganda from authoritarian practices: NGOs in Uganda are bound by governmental registration processes that interfere with operational autonomy as ministries have easy access to monitor non-governmental activities, and dissolution procedures. Ambiguous rules such as \u201corganizations shall not engage in any act which is prejudicial to the interests of Uganda and the dignity of the people of Uganda\u201d and \u201corganizations are prevented from engaging in any act which is \u2018prejudicial to the security of Uganda or any part of it\u2019\u201d are part of the official text of the NGO Regulation Statute and DENIVA\u2019s establishment served an important role in achieving fairness for Ugandan organizations.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Activities\" id=\"Activities\"></a><h2> Activities </h2>\n<p>As its name suggests, networking is the main activity undertaken by DENIVA: the network aims to assist members to digest and utilize positively the body of resources provided. DENIVA\u2019s resources are set to improve access to information on development and poverty; improve development information research; generate strong resource centers online and through Uganda; identify and campaign for global advocacy issues in a pro-people manner; and foster dialogue with development stakeholders. DENIVA\u2019s spectrum of activities can be broken down, specifically, into the following three areas:\n</p><p>Networking and Information Sharing: DENIVA, through information seminars and regional resource centers, serves as a facilitator, aiding member organizations in identifying and supplying for their own information needs. Communication with donors and members occur in a variety of ways, including email, telephone, national radio, and via the postal office (for members located in remote areas). DENIVA also tries to connect interested parties to help influence policy makers by providing a network ground for activists and analysts. \n</p><p>Self-understanding and capacity building: \u2013 DENIVA produces guidelines for NGOs and CSOs in addition to monitoring and conducting research to assist member organizations in developing independence and values in social organization and networking to achieve higher capabilities of collective action and participation in a democratic society. DENIVA\u2019s website contains assorted information on non-governmental organizations to provide knowledge and content for independent groups to develop their own structures. DENIVA authored literature on management of resource centers and also offers training in computer basics and information management. DENIVA offers means to connect organizations so they can build their capacities independently \u2013 through the network, organizations can \u201ctrade\u201d staff members so they can learn new skills and methods locally. DENIVA is especially concerned in training member organizations in operating within boundaries of gender sensitivity.\n</p><p>Policy Research and Advocacy (PRAP): DENIVA provides a unified venue for deliberation in development issues, targeting coherence, sophistication, intensity, and consistency improvements in the advocacy work of member organizations. Research found on DENIVA\u2019s website offers studies of the relationship of non-governmental organizations and politics, corruption, health, poverty, and information, solidifying knowledge into one easily accessible database which ultimately benefits member organizations to develop thorough comprehension of the diversity of information available.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2> Funding </h2>\n<p>DENIVA attains funding via donations and membership subscriptions. Some of the key donating organizations include the Ford Foundation, OXFAM, NOVIB, Action Aid International (Uganda), the International Institute for Environment Development (IIED UK), DANIDA (associated donors of the organization), MS Uganda, Logo Link, Aga Khan, CUTS- London, CUTS- India, and the Overseas Development Institute, UK. The variety of donors suggests that DENIVA\u2019s mission appeals not only to Ugandan society but also major international entities.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects\" id=\"Major_Projects\"></a><h2> Major Projects </h2>\n<p>DENIVA, as a long range networking organization, has many projects working with poverty amongst the rural portions of Uganda. One of the largest efforts of DENIVA lies in coordinating other member organizations and supplying them with necessary information with the objective of building a stronger environment for their collective action and individual NGO pursuits. It can be said that DENIVA\u2019s major project is to aid Uganda into achieving a higher quality of life and a stronger democratic society in the country. DENIVA has a strong commitment to projects regarding decentralization of power: research, workshops and studies in self-governance have been sponsored and organized by DENIVA in attempts to reinforce autonomy for non-governmental organizations of Uganda. DENIVA is also strongly devoted to enhance citizen participation and the empowerment of civil societies.\n</p><p>From 2006 to 2008, DENIVA ran the Poverty Eradication &amp; Livelihoods Improvement Programme(PELIP). The self explanatory goals aimed by the project were radical and aimed at helping the most marginalized portion of the Ugandan population. DENIVA admits to the eerie outcome of PELIP: their website state that \u201cdespite the reportedly improved access in social services, such as primary education, primary health care, progress in households\u2019 incomes etc, DENIVA notes that the quality of these services is not yet showing substantial improvement in households\u2019 welfare. Unfortunately, the poor have not benefited equally with the rest of the population.\u201d\n</p><p>Uganda\u2019s historical background also suggests major involvement of DENIVA with assurance of NGO autonomy in the country.  Organizations are required by Ugandan law to register and abide by rules of the 1989 NGO Registration Statute (and subsequent amendments); Scholar Aili Mari Tripp points out that \u201cSeveral hundred NGOs under the auspices of the Development Network of Indigenous Voluntary Associations met in 2001 to resist this focus on security and reject key elements of the bill as threatening NGO autonomy and undermining the constitutional provision of freedom of association.\u201d\n</p>\n<a name=\"Evaluation_and_Critique\" id=\"Evaluation_and_Critique\"></a><h2> Evaluation and Critique </h2>\n<p>Basing off the analytic process of deliberation, DENIVA is at a respectable position: the website has produced a solid information base comprised of resources, case studies and research that aids the formation enlightened opinions. DENIVA provides an infrastructure that supplies for the articulation of Ugandan society shared and distinct views and values, especially ensuring an understanding of rural minorities. DENIVA\u2019s research offers a broad range of views on issues related to non-governmental organizations, with regards of the positive and negative aspects of issues studies. DENIVA\u2019s approach to decision making itself is well informed: considering the range of research done by DENIVA, the organization is able to make key decisions and act as an influential stakeholder in issues of power decentralization, policy making, and citizen participation, having established itself over the years as a well reputed NGO in Uganda. \n</p><p>The social aspect of deliberation is ensured with DENIVA commitments to local CSO and NGO equal participation \u2013 tribal organizations have as much of an opportunity to  be heard as do the main board of the network. Education is a key aspect of DENIVA:  through its workshops and research, the network aims at ensuring comprehension of key aspects of the network that affect all of its participants (utilizing the website, computer workshops, and understanding case studies). Respect is strongly encouraged by DENIVA as there is special attention to the most fragile social groups of Uganda need to equal participation and representation.  The very aspect of national networking ensures the consideration of ideas and experiences from all portions of Ugandan society \u2013 an organization interested in decentralizing power and bringing equal opportunity to its citizens would not be expected to do otherwise.\n</p>\n<a name=\"References\" id=\"References\"></a><h2> References </h2>\n<p>Sustainable Activities Case Study - <a href=\"http://www.sustainableicts.org/DENIVA%20F.pdf\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.sustainableicts.org/DENIVA%20F.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sustainableicts.org/DENIVA%20F.pdf</a>\n</p><p>The Changing Face of Authoritarianism in Africa: The Case of Uganda - <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4187590\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4187590\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4187590</a>\n</p><p>United States International Grantmaking - Uganda - <a href=\"http://www.usig.org/countryinfo/uganda.asp#_ref3\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.usig.org/countryinfo/uganda.asp#_ref3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.usig.org/countryinfo/uganda.asp#_ref3</a>\n</p><p>The Communication Initiative Network - <a href=\"http://www.comminit.com/en/node/120940/307\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.comminit.com/en/node/120940/307\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.comminit.com/en/node/120940/307</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Links\" id=\"Links\"></a><h2> Links </h2>\n<p>DENIVA's Home Page - <a href=\"http://deniva.or.ug/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://deniva.or.ug/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://deniva.or.ug/</a>\n</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "Kampala", "title_en": "Development Network of Indigenous Voluntary Associations (DENIVA)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/development-network-indigenous-voluntary-associations-deniva", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 19' 39.7776\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "266", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "32\u00b0 34' 3.0648\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2012-02-03T14:33:09", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "actively recruiting", "post_date": "2010-12-07T12:21:19", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "322", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Canada", "content_country": "Canada", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": "50", "issue": "Education &amp; Schools||Budgeting||Economic Development||Environment||Health||Immigration||National &amp; International Security||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<p><a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a></p><h2>Mission and Purpose</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.c2d2.ca/\">Canadian Community for Dialogue and Deliberation (C2D2) website</a>, the organization's mission is \"to increase our society\u2019s capacity to have constructive conversations to enhance decision- making and collaborative action, to improve relationships and generate insight and knowledge \u2013 in short, to strengthen democracy\".</p><p>The purpose behind creating C2D2 was to strengthen communities through dialogue and deliberation (D&amp;D).

Using strictly structured events, TED aims to provide a way to connect visionaries to people that have the capacity to make things happen, to truly form a connected network of human beings that aim for the common good of all. \n</p><p>In January 2009, videos of talks available on TED.com had been viewed 50 million times; by July 2010, that value has ballooned to 290 million views.<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a> As the organization has grown, a new breed of events under the name TEDx aim to localize and increase the reach of TED, with 1000 independent events in over 60 countries in 2010.<a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2010/11/15/the-1000th-tedx-event-was-today/\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://blog.ted.com/2010/11/15/the-1000th-tedx-event-was-today/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a> Notable presenters in past TED events include Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Gordon Brown, Bill Gates, and various other university professors and Nobel Prize winners.<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a>\n</p>\n\n<a name=\"Purpose_and_Mission\" id=\"Purpose_and_Mission\"></a><h2>Purpose and Mission</h2>\n<p>According to the TED website, the mission of TED is to spread ideas. Here is a direct excerpt: \n\u201cWe believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and ultimately, the world. So we\u2019re building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world\u2019s most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.\u201d<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/5\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/5\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"History\" id=\"History\"></a><h2>History</h2>\n<p>TED was formed in 1984 as a one-time conference by Richard Saul Wurman, which later became an annual event starting in 1990. Later in 2002, the TED conference was purchased by Chris Anderson for the Sapling Foundation. Only in recent years, as the growth of online media, has TED become the organization we know of today. Starting in 2007, lectures done at TED and TEDx events (otherwise known as \u201ctalks\u201d) have been hosted on YouTube and available on iTunes.\n</p><p>To truly appeal to the global community nature of TED, volunteer members of TED have participated in the Open Translation Project to translate the talks into 80 languages, free of charge. Building upon the \u201cradical openness\u201d ethos, TED content is licensed for free to anyone wanted access to TED content.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Activities\" id=\"Activities\"></a><h2>Activities</h2>\n<p>TED as an organization is quite large, with programs that deal with various aspects involved with TED events. \n</p>\n<a name=\"TEDx\" id=\"TEDx\"></a><h3>TEDx</h3>\n<p>TEDx stands as a program that provides a TED experience on a more regional/local area, enabling schools, businesses, and other interest groups to host events that are independent of the main TED events to address issues more relevant to the area.<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/tedx\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/tedx\" rel=\"nofollow\">[6]</a> Well known TEDx events include TEDxParis, TEDxYouth, and TEDxUSC. \n</p>\n<a name=\"TED_Fellows\" id=\"TED_Fellows\"></a><h3>TED Fellows</h3>\n<p>TED Fellows is a fellowship program that \u201chelps world-changing innovators from around the globe become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities. Fellows are drawn from many disciplines that reflect the diversity of TED's members: technology, entertainment, design, the sciences, the humanities, the arts, NGOs, business and more.\u201d<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/241\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/241\" rel=\"nofollow\">[7]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"TED_Prizes\" id=\"TED_Prizes\"></a><h3>TED Prizes</h3>\n<p>Starting in 2005, TED Prizes awarded three distinguished individuals $100,000 each annually to assist them in fulfilling a wish they expressed in changing the world. In 2010, only one prize winner was chosen, in order to focus resources to increase the winner\u2019s chance of accomplishing his/her wish.<a href=\"http://www.tedprize.org/\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.tedprize.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[8]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Funding\" id=\"Funding\"></a><h2>Funding</h2>\n<p>According to TED, \u201cTED is owned by The Sapling Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization under US tax code. It was established in 1996 by Chris Anderson, who was at that time a magazine publishing entrepreneur.\u201d\n</p><p>The main TED event is sponsored by many corporations such as:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Akamai\n</li><li>BlackBerry\n</li><li>AT&amp;T\n</li><li>Autodesk\n</li><li>Cisco\n</li><li>GE\n</li><li>IBM\n</li><li>IDEO\n</li><li>Intel\n</li><li>Liberty Mutual\n</li><li>Rolex\n</li><li>Santander\n</li><li>Steelcase\n</li><li>Tiffany &amp; Co. Foundation\n</li><li>UBC\n</li><li>and many others\n</li></ul><p>TEDx events are responsible for finding their own sponsors for their events, many of which end up being sponsors local to where the event is located. The list of sponsors must be provided prior to an event, and the TED organization heavily regulates who can sponsor and requires transparency in donations.\n</p><p>For events that have less than 100 attendees, total sponsorship funding cannot exceed $5000, while events with more than 100 attendees are limited to less than $20000 per sponsor. Attendees themselves end up sponsoring the event themselves, with ticket prices for the main TED event running around the range of $5000 per person (which not only accounts for attendance, but copies of content TED provides to attendees). TEDx events also have ticket prices to attend, however prices scale to the popularity and location of the event. \n</p><p>However, TED makes it very clear for their own events and TEDx events that sponsors cannot originate from the weapons/ammunition, tobacco/cigarettes, and Adult-oriented product/service industries. In addition, rules clearly dictate that sponsors cannot have any \u201ceditorial control or veto power over your program\u201d<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/491\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/491\" rel=\"nofollow\">[9]</a>.  On top of that, sponsors cannot be present in anyway on the stage, further cementing the gap between sponsors and content discussed in TED events, making the talks credible and opening the doors for potentially controversial topics to be discussed.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Major_Projects\" id=\"Major_Projects\"></a><h2>Major Projects</h2>\n<a name=\"Open_Translation_Project\" id=\"Open_Translation_Project\"></a><h3>Open Translation Project</h3>\n<p>To respond to the popularity of TED and TEDx events around the world, TED launched a program called the Open Translation Project. By combining the large human capital of the attendees and TED volunteers, the program aims to provide subtitles and time-coded transcripts for all of the TED talks available. At the time of writing, 80 languages are represented in 13357 translations by 4353 translators on various talks made at TED events. The languages with a large amount of translations include Czech, French, Hebrew, Korean, Romanian, and Spanish.<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/translation\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/translation\" rel=\"nofollow\">[10]</a>\n</p>\n<a name=\"Evaluation_and_Critique\" id=\"Evaluation_and_Critique\"></a><h2>Evaluation and Critique</h2>\n<p>Various aspects of TED and TEDx events support deliberation, in the broad sense and in the details. One of the fundamental principles of deliberation is the collaboration of individuals from different perspectives and disciplines combining their intellect and experiences to form a broad and encompassing base of knowledge. At TED events, some of the brightest individuals on the planet are present, setting the potential for very high level deliberation. Some criticism has arisen over the fact that TED attendees must be invited to attend the events, many of which must go through an extensive application process to gauge potential attendee\u2019s dedication to truly participating in the event. In addition, many view the high attendance costs (roughly $5000), as a form of elitism, limiting the accessibility of TED to everyone. However, I counter that the point of TED events are to provide a place for the very best of our society to tackle real-world problems in revolutionary ways, ultimately resulting in high-caliber ideas meeting the attention of those who have the capacity to make change happen. On top of that, much of the content from TED events are available online for the public to view, therefore allowing the viewer to view the talks and discuss it amongst their own peers. \n</p><p>TED events are structured to have multiple back-to-back lectures at strictly 18 minutes or less from various visionaries, which is meant to stimulate the mind of many. However, this tends to be TED\u2019s weakness in terms of deliberation; where it doesn\u2019t provide time for the group to consider and discuss the pros and cons to ideas/solutions presented to them while the content is still fresh in the attendee\u2019s mind. TEDx events on the other hand allow breakout sessions between each lecture to allow for proper \u201cdigestion\u201d of the content being presented to them. The event organizers are strictly told to allow proper time for the group to break up into smaller groups and process talks, which guarantees that events across the board follow the same standard.<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/480\" class=\"external autonumber\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/480\" rel=\"nofollow\">[11]</a> \n</p><p>In typical deliberative sessions, the group attempts to come to a general consensus and then that consensus is relayed to people or entities that have the power to execute. A major aspect where the TED organization succeeds is being able to make those two groups of people one and the same. With major attendees like Cameron Diaz to philanthropists like Bill Gates, the people with the capacity to make change are the audience to some of the most engaging proposals to benefit the world ever. This adds a step to the deliberative process, execution.\n</p><p>With a large foundation of knowledge combined with the brightest individuals on the planet, TED supports a form of global deliberation. It doesn\u2019t tackle just national problems, but problems that are in the interests of everyone, whether they know it or not. Every idea has a relatively free chance to be presented to everyone, with the no difference between popular and controversial talks. With far ranging topics from global politics to the bleeding edge of technology, deliberation at TED facilitates the propagation of ideas and inspires many to take up an issue.\n</p>\n<a name=\"References\" id=\"References\"></a><h2>References</h2>\n<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/42\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/42\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/42</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2010/11/15/the-1000th-tedx-event-was-today/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://blog.ted.com/2010/11/15/the-1000th-tedx-event-was-today/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.ted.com/2010/11/15/the-1000th-tedx-event-was-today/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/5\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/pages/5</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/tedx\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/tedx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/tedx</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/241\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/241\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/241</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.tedprize.org/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.tedprize.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tedprize.org/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/translation\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/translation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/translation</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/480\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/pages/480\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/pages/480</a>\n</li></ol><a name=\"Secondary_Literature\" id=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a><h2>Secondary Literature</h2>\n<ul><li>Zuniga, D., Stanley, C., Arden, D., Latham, S., Gore, A., Brilliant, L.

Since its founding in 1993, the group has used this network to improve citizen participation and the free involvement of civilians around shared causes (civil society). CIVICUS sees itself as an international platform for connecting similarly-concerned citizens to each other, as well as to information resources, and possibly being a conduit for the creation of new NGOs. There are 450 participants in around 110 different countries.<a href=\"#cite_note-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a> The purpose of this membership is to create an influential force by coordinating with partner NGOs and NGO leaders. These members' influence spans from the local to international levels. The nature of the various NGOs is diverse in terms of their contribution to civil society, including: \u201ccivil society networks and organizations; trade unions; faith-based networks; professional associations; NGO capacity development organizations; philanthropic foundations and other funding bodies; businesses; and social responsibility programs.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a> <a id=\"Purpose_and_Mission\" name=\"Purpose_and_Mission\"></a></p><h2>Purpose and Mission</h2><p>\u201cCIVICUS has a vision of a global community of active, engaged citizens committed to the creation of a more just and equitable world.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a></p><p>The group wants to increase the influence of ordinary citizens, and believes civil society capable of solving problems that business or government cannot.The purpose of CIVICUS is to help nations to improve citizen participation in community service and around shared humanitarian causes. This action is meant to connect with governments and encourage them to cultivate what they see as an under-cultivated resource, civilian engagement.</p><p>More specifically, the goal is to aid civil society oriented, non-profit NGOs in the protection, restoration, or expansion of \u201ccivic space\u201d, civilian freedom and motivation to gather around and solve social problems. In a 2005 interview, CIVICUS's Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo, stated that at the time, the focus of the group was rectifying the \u201cattack on civil liberties that is happening in the context of the war on terror.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a>All of these goals are founded on the opinion that a democracy can only exist if it allows, and more importantly harnesses, the energy and creativity of its citizenry.</p><p>The stated values the CIVICUS views as integral to its purpose as they appear on the CIVICUS website:<a href=\"#cite_note-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a></p><ul><li>Justice and Equality - CIVICUS believes in the equality and dignity of every person, and that all people should be free to exercise their rights as citizens as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</li><li>Reciprocity - CIVICUS exists to ensure that people treat one another with the respect with which they themselves wish to be treated. Civil society cannot thrive without mutual respect.</li><li>Knowledge - CIVICUS recognises that to increase its global awareness of civil society and before it can assist or take action, it needs to form alliances with other concerned bodies to increase its influence and knowledge.</li><li>Vision - CIVICUS is realistic about conflict in today's world, but remains optimistic that most people, organisations, governments and businesses will work together for the benefit of all.</li><li>Principled Courage - CIVICUS will always promote civil justice and pledges to act in a manner that honours the principles of democratic civil society.</li></ul><p>In pursuit of the realization of these values, CIVICUS works to expand and protect free association and collective action rights, improving civil society management, particularly in goal setting, and encouraging productive relationships between civil society organizations and other institutions. <a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>The development of CIVICUS began in 1991 with the meeting of a group of twenty civil society leaders and the agreement to form an experimental international alliance of individuals and NGOs with the aim of enhancing civil society around the globe. CIVICUS was officially formed in Barcelona in 1993 and the original board consisted of members from 18 different countries. Since then it has expanded and begun many new projects. The first CIVICUS World Assembly was held in 1995, and it has been held many times since. It is largely out of these conferences that the initiatives were begun: The Civil Society Index in 2000, The Affinity Group of National Associations in March 2004, The Civil Society Watch in 2005, and the Legitmacy, Transparency, and Accountability initiative began in 2010.<a href=\"#cite_note-5\" title=\"\">[6]</a></p><p>When CIVICUS was founded, it was temporarily based in Washington D.C., but it relocated and is permanently headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. Kumi Naidoo was the Secretary General of CIVICUS between mid 1998 and 2008, presiding over the majority of the organization's growth. He was replaced soon after leaving by Ingrid Srinath, who is still serving. <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>Outside of the main four campaigns under the CIVICUS umbrella, the Affinity Group of National Organizations (AGNA) and the CIVICUS World Assembly (CWA) are both important undertakings for the organization.</p><p>The CIVICUS World Assembly is a conference that has been held periodically since 1995. It has taken place all over the world; six different countries for nine conferences. This conference is open to participation from the general public, business, and civil society and government leaders. A few past speakers at the CWA: Former US President Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, and Former Ireland President Mary Robinson. The conference picks a new theme each time; the last two theme statements were \u201cPeople, Participation and Power\u201d and \u201cAccountability: Delivering Results.\u201d<a href=\"#cite_note-6\" title=\"\">[7]</a></p><p>The Affinity Group of National Associations was started in 2004 for the purpose of gathering networks of NGOs that operate on a national or regional level. The focus of AGNA is creating a resource for information on civil society as well as encouraging international coordinated civic engagement in trans-boundary causes.

The idea is that it will be used to develop plans for strengthening civil society in each nation that uses it. The CSI is managed by national level NGOs to expand the base of knowledge useful for strengthening civil society. Government, supporters, and scholars all are involved with a nation's CSI process.</p><p>To achieve positive change, the CSI conductors use \u201cparticipatory and other research methods to create an assessment of the state of civil society.\u201d Once finished, the findings are used to create goals and a plan for the improved quality and sustainability of civil society in the medium to long term. Part of this improvement consists of increasing real world impact on community problems and social progress. <a href=\"#cite_note-10\" title=\"\">[11]</a></p><p>The Participatory Governance Programme (PGP) focuses on governments and NGOs in the southern hemisphere. It works to improve the accountability and citizen involvement in these governmental action at all levels. The way the PGP seeks to do this is by increasing the knowledge base regarding the effective execution of participatory government, by educating facilitators on how best to cultivate civic involvment, by strengthening connections between volunteers/NGOs and government leaders/institutions and by providing support to new, original projects/methods supported by both government and civil society, and aimed at promoting participatory governance.</p><p>The purpose of the Legitimacy, Transparency, and Accountability Programme (LTA) is to develop institutional mechanisms make civil society organizations more transparent and accountable. This is done with the belief that NGOs cannot be effective or sustainable without accountability measures. This initiative works to recognize and analyze legitimacy threats, to institute appropriate methods of ensuring accountability, and to continue to learn and develop effective mechanisms based on prior instances of LTA issues.</p><p>Civil Society Watch (CSW) is a program relating to the timely identification and response to what is evaluated to be a threat to civil society and democratic liberties, mostly from the perspective that states are reacting to terrorism and other threats by instituting policies that are unacceptably intrusive. The primary way of doing this is the Early Warning System that the program has developed. This system works by monitoring media, governmental publication/statements, IGO reports, NGO reports, and in some cases civilian observation, and then producing an assessment every two weeks on possible jeopardy to civil society. The actions following these reports may include press statements, writing letters to decision making bodies, etc. <a id=\"Evaluation_and_Critique\" name=\"Evaluation_and_Critique\"></a></p><h2>Evaluation and Critique</h2><p>CIVICUS is not exactly a deliberation-dedicated body, but clearly its values and goals are oriented toward the sharing of knowledge, the freedom of ideas and association, and drawing the citizenry into participation in issues at the local to global level. These aims will both directly and indirectly provide support for good deliberation.</p><p>By promoting participation in NGO work and civic involvement, CIVICUS encourages the education of citizens in social and political issues. This also allows for the consideration of more and presumably more diverse viewpoints. Through its creation of various forums for international information exchange, CIVICUS broadens the knowledge base of leaders in diverse fields. These platforms allow more people to express their viewpoints. The LTA initiative augments these benefits by working to shed light on the origins of information and possible viewpoint influences, improving the knowledge base's quality.</p><p>Also, the CWA is a deliberative body. The conference attracts participants from all over the world. The CWA evaluates itself on criteria such as southern hemisphere and regional participation, and participant learning. The conference is broken into much smaller workshops, with greater individual participation the goal. <a id=\"Citations\" name=\"Citations\"></a></p><h2>Citations</h2><ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-0\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-0\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicus.org\">CIVICUS Website</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-1\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicus.org\">CIVICUS Website</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-2\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org/who-we-are\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicus.org/who-we-are\">CIVICUS Website: Who We Are</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-3\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> [Interview with Julia Kay]</li><li id=\"cite_note-4\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org/who-we-are\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicus.org/who-we-are\">CIVICUS Website: Who We Are</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-5\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org/history\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicus.org/history\">CIVICUS Website: Organizational History</a></li><li id=\"cite_note-6\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicusassembly.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=85&amp;lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicusassembly.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=85&amp;lang=en\">CIVICUS World Assembly Website</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-7\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org/affinity-group-of-national-associations\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicus.org/affinity-group-of-national-associations\">CIVICUS Website: AGNA</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-8\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.civicus.org/images/stories/civicus/Annualreports/Annual_Report_2008.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.civicus.org/images/stories/civicus/Annualreports/Annual_Report_2008.pdf\">CIVICUS Annual Report Brochure</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-9\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/world/world-voluntarism-group-forms.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/world/world-voluntarism-group-forms.html\">NYT Article</a>.</li><li id=\"cite_note-10\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\" title=\"\">\u2191</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://civicus.org/csi\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://civicus.org/csi\">Civil Society Index</a>.</li></ol><p><a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><p>Greene, Stephen G. \"Citizen Action Is Key to Successful Global Change, Alliance Says.\" Chronicle of Philanthropy 13, no. 22 (September 6, 2001): 41.

It is very similar to many other state ran orginazation that tries to help promote the idea of Deliberative Democracy and helping the people in our country to learn to speak up and be informed about Political and Social issues. \n</p><p>The one set back of this organization is that it is very localized, and mainly focuses on the state of Kansas. However it is a very good model organization that could help motivate other states that don't currently have organizations like the ICDD to use them as an example to model after. Therefore if every state has their own ICDD than it can all work together to form one National ICDD.\n</p>\n<a name=\"References\" id=\"References\"></a><h2>References</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/about\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://icdd.k-state.edu/about</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/what-we-do\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/what-we-do\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://icdd.k-state.edu/what-we-do</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://icdd.k-state.edu/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.ruralgrocery.org/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.ruralgrocery.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ruralgrocery.org/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://services.bepress.com/jpd/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://services.bepress.com/jpd/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://services.bepress.com/jpd/</a>\n</li></ul><a name=\"Secondary_Literature\" id=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a><h2>Secondary Literature</h2>\n<ul><li>David Procter Moderated a Lecture on Judicial Diversity (David Procter 2009)\n</li></ul><ul><li>The Deliberative Democracy Handbook\u2014Strategies for Effective Civic Engagement in the Twenty First Century (John Gastil, 2005)\n</li></ul><ul><li>Midterm Mud: Making a Mess of Elections (Jeffery Weiss 2010)\n</li></ul><a name=\"Links\" id=\"Links\"></a><h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.heartlandfoundation.org/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.heartlandfoundation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.heartlandfoundation.org/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.interactivityfoundation.org/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.interactivityfoundation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.interactivityfoundation.org/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.kansasarmynationalguard.com/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.kansasarmynationalguard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kansasarmynationalguard.com/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.kettering.org/\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kettering.org/</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"http://www.deliberative-democracy.net\" class=\"external free\" title=\"http://www.deliberative-democracy.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.deliberative-democracy.net</a>\n</li></ul>", "geo_city": "Kansas City", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "The Institute for Civic Discourse & Democracy", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/institute-civic-discourse-democracy", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "39\u00b0 11' 19.6296\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "273", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "96\u00b0 35' 3.0408\" W", "fulltime_staff": "30", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2012-01-09T20:39:13", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Elisabeth MacNamara", "post_date": "2010-12-08T03:30:34", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "330", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Washington", "geo_country": "United States", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Education &amp; Schools||Budgeting||Economic Development||Environment||Health||Immigration||National &amp; International Security||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<p>The League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan political organization, established in 1920 to rework and improve the structure of government and benefit public policies by educating and engaging American citizens in public advocacy. The League of Women Voters is a grassroots organization composed of the people and operates on a National, State, and Local level. There are leagues represented in all fifty states, in addition to many local leagues across the globe. There are approximately 150,000 members nationwide (as of 2006). The League of Women voters operates on a national level with grassroots support from state and local leagues. <a href=\"#cite_note-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Purpose_and_Mission\" name=\"Purpose_and_Mission\"></a></p><h2>Purpose and Mission</h2><p>The league of women voters does not support or oppose candidates at any level of government participation. The league, however, is very political, striving to \u201cinfluence policy through advocacy\u201d and declaring their support or opposition of political issues (after examining them and reaching a consensus on a position. The league is described as the \u201coriginal grassroots citizen network\u201d and is directed by the general consensus of its members nationwide (900 state and local league). The league strives to enhance comprehension of major public policy issues through education and advocacy, along with lobbying in congress. The incumbent president of the League is Elisabeth MacNamara and Nancy E. Tate is the Executive Director. <a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Carrie Chapman Catt founded the league in 1920 in Chicago in the wake of the final meeting of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The establishment of the league was roughly six month prior to the Ninetieth amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. Maud Wood Park was the first president. Initially, the organization strived to help newly enfranchised women become familiar with the voting process; such as where to register, how to assess candidate and ballot information, and what to do at the polling boxes. <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Though the organization was composed of women the league did not want its activities to be confined to women\u2019s issues. The three chief aims of the organization were to: 1. Complete enfranchisement of all women, 2. To remove all legal discrimination against women, 3.to make democracy safe so that every citizen feels secure and other nations acknowledge the United States as legitimate. <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a> The league was divided into seven regions with regional directors and officers in addition to an overarching board of directors and a president (Maud Wood Park). In the league third year it took global initiative by inviting representatives from Latin American nations to participate in a pan American conference of women. In 1973, the league allowed males to join. Prior to this it was an all female organization. One of the first bills the league endorsed was the Sheppard-Towner Act in 1921, which provided federal aid for maternal and child care programs. This was the leagues first effective use of grassroots organization and active citizen education to organize participants into action. <a href=\"#cite_note-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a> In 1930, the league fought to solve a government corruption issue; hundreds of federal employees were politically supported in their government jobs. The league endorsed the merit system, which would base merit on the individual\u2019s qualifications. This system would attempt to stop the government practice of giving federal jobs under the \u201cSpoils System.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-5\" title=\"\">[6]</a> The league was successful in helping to reduce this practice and in 1938 the Bill was passed which placed jobs under civil service. The league became more environmentally oriented in 1933 when they supported a legislation to develop The Tennessee River basin, the site of a publically owned power facility. The league continued their environmental pursuits by working to enact and implement the clean air act and the clean water act. The league also focused on the lack of public transportation and ways to promote conservation. In 1960 and 70s the league focused more on basic human rights, such as the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The league focused its efforts on the 1980s Roe v. Wade Case, which granted women the constitutional right to make reproductive choices. In the 1990s the league refined their education fund by established a project to help guide civic education of women in emerging democracies. During this time the league worked to help register more Americans to vote by passing the national voter registration act. This act would help clarify the registration process and improve and reshape the position the government plays in the registration process. Currently, the league is working on health care reforms, effective gun control, and finance reforms. <a href=\"#cite_note-6\" title=\"\">[7]</a></p><p><a id=\"Current_issues\" name=\"Current_issues\"></a></p><h2>Current issues</h2><p>The leagues issues can be categorized into four categories of activity; representative government, international relations, natural resources, and social policy.</p><p><a id=\"Representative_government\" name=\"Representative_government\"></a></p><h3>Representative government</h3><p>\u201cPromote an open governmental system that is representative, accountable and responsive.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-7\" title=\"\">[8]</a></p><p><a id=\"Campaign_finance\" name=\"Campaign_finance\"></a>Campaign finance</p><p>In the 2008 presidential campaign, the league urged candidates to back the reform to the Presidential Public Financing System and legislation to fix public financing systems for the president, in addition to establishing a congressional public financing for the first time. <a href=\"#cite_note-8\" title=\"\">[9]</a></p><p><a id=\"Citizen_Participation\" name=\"Citizen_Participation\"></a>Citizen Participation</p><p>In the 109th Congress the League supported The Openness Promoted Effectiveness in our National Government Act.

Bush Radio combines a unique amalgam of music and discussions of important issues in each of their broadcasts. After a rough beginning amidst segregation and persecution in Cape Town, South Africa, this station prides itself in its methods of enticing the public to contribute to the confabulations. Programs from Bush Radio all have underlying purposes and targeted audiences, which use their uncommon formats to educate, stimulate conversation, and develop the minds of all listeners.</p><p>Mission Statement</p><p>Bush Radio wrote its mission statement when it first began over a decade ago, yet it still is applied to each program today. It reads as follows:</p><p>\u201cTo ensure that communities who have been denied access to resources take part in producing ethical, creative and responsible radio that encourages them to communicate with each other, to take part in decisions that affect their lives, and to celebrate their own cultures. Through such radio, communities will affirm their own dignity and identity, and promote social responsibility and critical thinking\u201d.</p><p>History</p><p>In 1989, during the height of the apartheid era in South Africa, a community service project called Cassette Education Trust (CASET) began, which involved dispersing cassette tapes that brought about information to help build a dependable democracy. These tapes were the equivalence of a political talk radio program, but were not punishable by the government due to the non-broadcasted nature of the discussions. Unfortunately with CASET, community input was impossible; yet the idea for Bush Radio came from the combination of the CASET contents and nature of speech, with the ability for listeners to contribute their viewpoints on the issues.</p><p>Bush Radio formed in 1992, but did not broadcast until April 25th, 1993. Unfortunately, the station had not been granted a broadcasting license from the government, and within hours of that broadcast, the government arrested and charged the company\u2019s major leaders and seized vital broadcasting equipment. Protests from the Bush Radio students and volunteers pressured the government to drop the charges against the Chairperson and Coordinator of the station and return all of the equipment. In 1994, South Africa had their first democratic elections, which brought a more integrated society upon South Africa. This also brought about the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), which was meant to supervise the radio industry in South Africa at the time; it was the IBA which first granted Bush Radio it\u2019s broadcasting license, first temporarily but later reinstated permanently in 2002. Since 2002, Bush Radio has been broadcasting 24/7 with more than just musical content.</p><p>Listener Participation</p><p>The programs offered by Bush Radio vary in format and structure. Some programs discuss African politics and have callers contribute their opinions to the debate. For example, on Saturday afternoons, the topic changes to underage drinking and drugs as teenagers talk on air, while also asking for callers to add to the deliberation on these issues. On Friday evenings, Michael Parenti \u2013 a political author and lecturer \u2013 is a featured speaker in the commentary. These discussions are presented amidst the vast musical selection in a unique style that holds interests, yet provides stimulating and inviting conversations about various separate topics.</p><p>Bush Radio and the Community</p><p>Bush Radio participates actively in the community, making it much more than just a radio station. It not only broadcasts, but it also engages in uplifting community projects, provides scholarships and training programs for those interested in a radio career path, as well as investing in human potential development at all ages. Some of the most prominent Bush Radio regional projects include the Youth Against Aids (YAA) and the collaboration with the South African Red Cross Society, with each project having its own relevant on-air segment. Furthermore, Bush Radio awards scholarships to candidates that they see with the most potential to succeed, mainly in the field of journalism/broadcasting. They also partner with Broadcasting Training Institute (BTI) to provide superior training to its member, including radio broadcasting, video journalism, drama production, documentary and feature production, and radio management, in order to create the most skilled staff and best radio program as possible. Finally, to see the community grow to it\u2019s highest potential, it has established a daycare for kids of the ages 3 months \u2013 2 years, the Children\u2019s Radio Education Workshop (CREW) program targets the development of the youth (ages 6-18) to mold them into media consumers of the future, and the Alternative Kurriculum Mentoring Youth (Alkemy) educates listeners between the ages 18-24 on political issues while beginning the basis for philosophical thought. Bush Radio works hard to push for a more knowledgeable pool of community members in the future for South Africa.</p><p>Bush radio is able to affiliate itself as a community radio due to its fulfillment of all three aspects of that specific category of broadcasting media, including access, participation and self-management. Bush Radio presents itself to the community in a friendly and welcoming environment through all of its activities. It encourages community involvement through callers and input on current issues and other topics. It is also uses a small staff \u2013 including trainees through the BTI partnership \u2013 and many volunteers to keep the station up and running.</p><p>In The Pink Program</p><p>In The Pink was a revolutionary concept for African radio; this program was the first widespread gay and lesbian media outlet on the entire continent. The purpose of such a program was to provide \u201ca platform to voice the struggle from the perspective of gay identity\u201d according to it\u2019s main producer, Adrian Alberts. The program allowed for poets, special musical guests and community listeners coping with homosexual struggles to call in and share their stories and inputs on current issues relevant to the overall program\u2019s theme. In The Pink provides an especially deliberative process with a talk show format, striving for the inclusion of a diverse community and general discussions of current gay and lesbian topics and opinions, while maintaining respect for all viewpoints.</p><p>Youth Against Aids and HIV-Hop Programs</p><p>In 2000, Bush Radio began the campaign against childhood AIDS, entitled Youth Against Aids (YAA). The purpose of this campaign and radio program was to educate high school students on the issue of HIV/AIDS at that time. The Bush Radio staff also set out to local schools once a month during this campaign to invite students to talk openly about sex-related topics in addition to weekly live shows during lunches. From YAA began a five-week on-air program, called HIV-Hop. This program is what started a mass involvement of teenagers in the broadcasted discussions of the AIDS epidemic. Teens from all over Cape Town, and other local areas, called in to add to the conversations during these programs. On one specific Friday night, a young man called in and began rapping about the AIDS crisis. The following quote is a small excerpt from that broadcast:</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold and lonely, coz it\u2019s eating you slowlyBrothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, kings and queensIt\u2019s all upon usThe clock is ticking and the score ain\u2019t in our favorPeople are dying it feels like dying is saferThe headlines read, AIDS hit the streetYou gotta open your ears, eyes and know the beatUnprotected sex, sharing needles\u201d</p><p>This began the mass of young adults calling Bush Radio to share their rhymes with the community. It also spawned passionate, on-air debates amongst teens about topics related to HIV/AIDS, such as condoms in schools and abstinence until marriage. After January 2002, the YAA and HIV-Hop programs ended, but in its place began a new program called Positive Living, which a more traditional and permanent broadcast of medical advice from experts about HIV/AIDS and other issues of the present.</p><p>Bush Radio Today</p><p>Currently, Bush Radio features six different discussion-based programs, including The Breakfast Show, The Morning Cruise, Sakhisizwe \u2013 bou die nasie (building the nation), Backchat with Bassie, Everyday People, and CREW. There are also 11 specialty music programs presented throughout different times in the week. Bush Radio also outreaches to a larger audience by offering the option of listening live from their website, as well as following their various social media pages. Bush Radio has won several awards for their unique integration of deliberation amongst community members through the radio, including the Prince Claus Award for Urban Heroes in 2000 and the second place award in the New York International Radio Festival in 2001 for HIV-Hop. They have also been honored with several awards from the Department of Communication in 2005, such as Best Provincial Achiever.</p><p>Sources</p><p>\u2022 \"About: Bushradio 89.5 FM.\" Bushradio 89.5 FM.

Once elected, the party\u2019s mandate will be used in accordance with the voting results for each and every question with the party\u2019s own direct democratic voting system. In this way direct democracy will be adapted in the pace wanted by the voters. The day the party has a superior majority in the Parliament of state nothing hinders proposals of abolishing the party system and convert Sweden to a downright direct democratic state.</p><p>Despite the fact that highly coloured statements in specific factual matters can find expression through the voting system of the party, the aim for the party is to remain neutral by its own. This means that the party neither now nor in the future will adapt any values in issues not specifically involved in how the world-political system will be more direct democratic.</p><p>The core activity of the party consequently consists of design, running, maintenance and introduction of a continuous direct-democratic voting system. Everyone that can vote in the general elections can also vote in said voting system. You don\u2019t even have to vote in elections for the party to be able to use the voting system.</p><p>The party will also work on solutions for all practical problems that can occur during use of the voting system. Since the voting system only will be accessible through terminals on a network, it is important to make sure that everybody to a reasonable cost can get access to such terminals and knowledge on how to use them. Among other issues, the party wants all libraries to work as voting offices where those who not have access to the network from home can give their votes. The librarians will be trained so they can show the voters how the system works.</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Founded in 2002.

Neo-liberal market reforms have likewise become controversial, with many critics arguing that they have failed to ease poverty or to spark economic growth.</p><p>Finally, China's apparent success in achieving sustained growth and reducing poverty, which stands out against these global trends, has revived the idea that authoritarian regimes can deliver greater economic security and social justice than their democratic rivals.</p><p>These sobering developments are frequently viewed in isolation. Together, however, they underscore the urgency of creative new thinking about democratic models of economic security and social justice in our volatile world. Neo-liberal models, predicated on the view that politics and markets operate according to different logics and that markets must be insulated from democratic regulation, have failed to deliver both in developed and developing countries.

In particular, this means direct democracy application to the indirectly democratic won seats in that citizens' constant and directly monitor and control the delegates. IDE aims to enrich with direct democracy without revolution or change of fundamental political system.\nIDE plans the on-going relay of the discussion in parliament, and to empower citizens to vote online about the topics discussed. The delegates have to reflect the directly democratic resolution of the citizens.\n\n<a name=\"The_mechanism_of_IDE\" id=\"The_mechanism_of_IDE\"></a><h2> The mechanism of IDE </h2>\nIDE want to implement direct democracy by citizens' control over the delegates chosen to represent them in parliament by the party within the framework of the existing political system of indirect democracy. The delegates in parliament representing the party:\n\n<ul><li> 1. will be chosen by lottery from those applying to serve as delegates of the party.\n</li><li> 2. those who win the lottery will serve as representatives on a rotating basis such that each will fill the seat for a month in case of the European Parliament, and or two months in case of the national government. In the European Parliament, where delegates are categorized by their party, IDE will be categorized as independent.\n</li><li> 3. will reflect the citizens' resolution when they vote in the parliament by voting in parliament according to the citizens' decisions on IDE's homepage.\n</li></ul>\nDifferences of opinion within IDE will be reflected in the positions taken in parliament by IDE delegates. For example, if a pending bill is supported by 60% of IDE member and is opposed by 40% and IDE has 10 seats in parliament, then six delegates would support and four would oppose the bill.\n[edit] The relation of IDE and the other parties\nSince IDE doesn\u2019t have its own political measures, as a matter of course doesn\u2019t make coalition with other parties. However, to support a political party through IDE is naturally practicable for the citizens.\n<a href=\"/methods/direct-democracy\" title=\"Direct Democracy\">Direct_Democracy</a> organisations present on Participedia", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Internetes DEmokr\u00e1cia p\u00e1rtja", "methods": "Direct Democracy", "path": "/organizations/internetes-demokr-cia-p-rtja", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "46\u00b0 31' 35.832\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "188", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "19\u00b0 38' 26.2896\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2011-12-21T21:41:17", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2011-01-14T22:58:39", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "343", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Finland", "content_country": "Finland", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<h2><a id=\"Change_2011_movement\" name=\"Change_2011_movement\"></a>Change 2011 movement</h2><p>One of the main goals of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.muutos2011.fi/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=88\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.muutos2011.fi/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=88\">Change 2011 movement</a> is to give citizens a possibility to influence decision-making process even during the time between elections. Year 2011 is a tiebreaker in Finnish politics. Lisbon agreement and the possible vote threshold coming into force will make the parliamentary elections of 2011 the last election where citizens are heard.</p><p>Western style democracy, the core belief of Change 2011, is further enhanced with so called direct democracy where citizens have a direct input in the decision-making process.</p><p>Main goal of the Change 2011 movement is to advance the interest of Finnish citizens. This is achieved by decision makers i.e. politicians following the will of the people. Change 2011 is trying to achieve this by offering direct democracy to support representative or parliamentary democracy and by extending the right to freedom of speech to include present day political dissidents.</p><p>Change 2011 has identified several areas where the decision maker\u2019s actions and public opinion is in conflict. Out of these present-day problems we will emphasize immigration policy, the unhealthy consensus political system and unreasonably lenient convictions for violent crimes offenders. <a id=\"1._Advancing_the_interest_of_Finnish_citizens\" name=\"1._Advancing_the_interest_of_Finnish_citizens\"></a></p><h2>1. Advancing the interest of Finnish citizens</h2><p>The most important task of the state of Finland is to protect the rights of its citizens. Prosperity and wealth is to be primarily spread amongst citizens. Funds collected by means of taxes are to be used for the wellbeing of citizens. In case of excess, it can be used for the benefit of other countries and their citizens. Tax income is to be used to the benefit of aging citizens and to ensure their quality of life as well as childcare and youth education. Other important targets are medical care, day-care opportunities for children and homeless people.</p><p>People are to be treated according to equality principle. People are not to be discriminated because of sex, age, ethnic origin, language, religion, conviction, opinion, health, handicap or other personal reason. Change 2011 does not accept special treatment of individuals or organisations at the expense of other individuals or groups in contradiction of the equality principle. Favouritism is a form of discrimination. <a id=\"2._Direct_democracy_to_support_parliamentary_democracy\" name=\"2._Direct_democracy_to_support_parliamentary_democracy\"></a></p><h2>2. Direct democracy to support parliamentary democracy</h2><p>Important decisions affecting the nation are done by means of direct democracy. The final decision then rests with Finnish citizens with right to vote.</p><p>Such decisions would be the decision to join NATO or accepting the Lisbon agreement.</p><p>The 3 pillars of direct democracy are citizen\u2019s initiatives, popular vote or referendum and selecting civil servants holding key positions.</p><p>Prescribed or predetermined number of citizens can initiate a Citizens initiative. If the initiative receives sufficient support it will then be subject to a referendum or popular vote.</p><p>Key civil servants such as the parliamentary ombudsman and prosecutor general of Finland, have a significant role in legislative process. Thus it is imperative to increase direct input in selecting these key civil servants.</p><p>Direct democracy referendums are easily run in parallel with municipal, parliamentary, EU-parliamentary and presidential elections, including Internet based elections. Out of the European nations, Switzerland is an established user of direct democracy both in principle and practice. <a id=\"3._Freedom_of_speech_includes_dissidents_and_those_expressing_opinions_different_from_mainstream\" name=\"3._Freedom_of_speech_includes_dissidents_and_those_expressing_opinions_different_from_mainstream\"></a></p><h2>3. Freedom of speech includes dissidents and those expressing opinions different from mainstream</h2><p>Freedom of speech is the cornerstone and livelihood of democracy. Restrictions to freedom of speech only advance the interest and goals of small groups. These same restrictions prevent dissidents from being heard. Freedom of speech should not only cover those ideas and thoughts that are well received and considered harmless or are generally ignored. Freedom of speech includes such messages and material that could potentially insult, shock or disturb the state or part of its population. This type of thinking provides for a solid foundation of an open pluralistic and democratic society. <a id=\"4._Retirement_of_consensus_politics\" name=\"4._Retirement_of_consensus_politics\"></a></p><h2>4. Retirement of consensus politics</h2><p>Present systems of consensus politics are incapable of political and economical reforms. The system is unable to view matters from alternative perspectives. Most of all, consensus politics is incapable of unbiased and constructive dialogue. Prime minister and minister of finance without due process decide many important issues affecting the whole nation. Amongst the results of the many years of consensus is the almost total lack of critical media and intellectuals capable of constructive dialogue and questioning of the establishment along with a moral values undermining individual liberties and values of citizens as well as refusing to address historical matters and a clear cover up to protect the interest of small political elite in the case of STASI related matters and Rosenholz material to be specific. <a id=\"5._Rationalization_of_immigration_politics\" name=\"5._Rationalization_of_immigration_politics\"></a></p><h2>5. Rationalization of immigration politics</h2><p>The aim of Change 2011 is a safe and economically stable Finland. Our critique concerning immigration politics and policy is directed to the government and parliament with legislative responsibility. Same laws and legality standards must be applied to all residents.</p><p>Immigration in general must be economically profitable for the country. Most of immigrants today fall under humanitarian migration group. This group is not governed or required by obligations to UN. Humanitarian immigration is a homemade invention of Finnish civil servants and authorities. Finland has no international obligations regarding humanitarian immigration. Parliament must pass an immigration or law pertaining to aliens where the key point is to guarantee the interest of citizens and the state. Prior to accepting this law a referendum binding the parliament must be held. Our operations program regarding immigration will lay the foundation for the new immigration and aliens law. <a id=\"6._Just_convictions_for_violent_crimes\" name=\"6._Just_convictions_for_violent_crimes\"></a></p><h2>6. Just convictions for violent crimes</h2><p>Being too lenient, convictions handed out by courts on violent crimes against persons, their life and health do not correspond the legal opinion of majority of citizens. Serious violent crimes include but are not limited to: murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, sexual crimes and driving under the influence leading to manslaughter.</p><p>Problems do not lie in deficient laws but rather how these laws are implemented. Especially youth crime must be interfered with at early stages and with strong measures. Preventive measures will stop many youths from falling into criminal life. Citizens right to self-defence, to defend family and property must be increased. One being subject to a violent crime must have a full right to self-defence with all means appropriate. <a href=\"/methods/direct-democracy\" title=\"Direct Democracy\">Direct_Democracy</a> organisations present on Participedia</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "F\u00f6r\u00e4ndring 2011", "methods": "Direct Democracy", "path": "/organizations/f-r-ndring-2011", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "63\u00b0 53' 55.4316\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "188", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "25\u00b0 45' 7.0308\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2011-12-21T21:06:22", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2011-01-19T04:26:30", "other_images": "[\"DDI-Web-Banner.png\"]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "344", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Ireland", "content_country": "Ireland", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.directdemocracyireland.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.directdemocracyireland.org/\">Direct Democracy Ireland</a> (DDI) was formed in June 2010, but the concept of direct democracy is not new in Ireland.

In the same document, Article 50 gave the Oireachtas the power to amend the constitution if the newly amended constitution is put up for a referendum vote within 2 years. In 1928 the Irish Democracy was severely weakened when the presiding Oireachtas amended the constitution by removing Articles 47 &amp; 48.

The site is a non-partisan joint project of two 501(c)3 non-profit organizations, the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation. OpenGovernment is independent from any government entity, candidate for office, or political party. The information contained on OpenGovernment pages, wherever applicable, is cited to a primary source-- while we aggregate many different data sources, we do not edit or manipulate government data in any way before presenting it here.</p><p>OpenGovernment comes from the team that brought you OpenCongress.org, a leading web tool for government transparency in the federal U.S. Congress. Conceived in 2004, the main problem that OpenCongress sought to address was a lack of accessible information online about bills, votes, and issues in the U.S. Congress. The official website of Congress, THOMAS, published raw data about legislation, but not in ways that are compliant with the community-generated Principles of Open Government Data, not in sufficiently timely ways, and not on webpages that were proven to be user-friendly. (More than 15 years after THOMAS' launch, it still doesn't come close to doing any of these things. The Library of Congress should move aggressively towards providing, among other things, bulk data access and a free API to the public.)</p><p>OpenCongress addressed this problem -- as much as possible given the inherited technical limitations of Congressional data sources -- by combining official government information with news &amp; blog coverage from around the open Web, campaign contribution info, public participation tools, and more. The resulting open-source OpenCongress web application enables individuals and organizations to track and share information about what's really happening in Congress. Since its launch in 2007, OpenCongress has grown to become the most-visited government transparency website in the United States, and is proud to be an active contributor to a burgeoning ecosystem of open-government resources online. Read more about OpenCongress.</p><p>Ever since we conceived of OpenCongress in 2004, we foresaw that this model of aggregating disparate data sources into a user-friendly web interface could be productively applied to other entities: state legislatures, city councils, neighborhood associations, international institutions, governorships, secretaries of state, supreme courts, circuit judges, public-mission institutions such as schools &amp; hospitals, foreign countries with more-or-less democratic systems of governance, and more.</p><p>In other words, we often received the quite-sensible question, \"When will there be an OpenCongress for my state?\" Or, \"... for my city?\" Or, \"... for my neighborhood?\" Or, ... \"for my country?\" We're happy to say we're on-track to answer that question. We're working with the staff at Sunlight Labs and many volunteers on the community-driven Open States Project, with the goal of establishing a data standard and collecting machine-readable data streams for all 50 U.S. State Legislatures. These data streams will provide official government info to GovKit, the open-source application that combines it with other publicly-available data sources and social wisdom from around the open Web. GovKit, in turn, will power the OpenGovernment website: essentially, free and non-partisan versions of OpenCongress for all fifty state legislatures and a dozen major cities, with even more local versions planned. We'll continue to encourage volunteers to remix the code for city, county, or municipal governments. Along the way, we've made our code more modular and better-documented, in order to make it possible for volunteers to make their own versions of OpenGovernment with an emphasis on the issues they and their communities care about.</p><p>So while our code has always been 100% open, we now have an even better answer to the question, \"How do I make an OpenCongress for my (state, city, town, or country)?\" OpenGovernment was designed to bring the OpenCongress model of transparency down to state and local governments.</p><p>The ultimate mission of OpenGovernment is to ensure that all three branches (executive, legislative, and judicial) at every level of government (federal, state, city, local, and more) comply with the Principles of Open Government Data. Public data can and should be public, immediately and in full, and it can and should be made accessible to everyone online, so as to increase trust in the political process. From this foundation of open government data, an entire ecosystem of public-interest tools can grow and evolve. Transparency, in turn, can create new opportunities for meaningful civic engagement in our representative democracy. Greater day-to-day civic engagement and citizen watchdogging, we believe, will result in reduced corruption in government, better public policy outcomes, and stronger democratic institutions.</p><p>Writing in early 2011, the situation with official websites for U.S. state legislatures is nearly exactly as it was with THOMAS in 2004. Unfortunately, almost no U.S. state government makes its data available in ways that are compliant with the Principles of Open Government Data, or even close. Out of the 49 bicameral state legislatures in the U.S. and one unicameral body (that of Nebraska), only one single chamber -- one entity out of 99, namely the New York State Senate -- makes its legislative data available in ways that sufficiently comply with the community-generated Eight Principles of Open Government Data. Every other chamber of state government remains insistently closed-off from its constituents, refusing to release public data (legislative actions, votes, bill analysis -- not to mention campaign contributions) online in ways that are truly open, despite the readily available technical means to do so. State legislatures, in other words, make public data \"defective by design\". Open-source software, open standards, flexible copyright licensing, and easily-findable technical best practices make it possible for any branch of state government to comply with the Eight Principles in a relatively short period of time ... given, of course, that the political &amp; institutional will exists to do so. And that's just to address the back-end data issues... on the front-end, the status quo for state-level government websites is a mishmash of non-standards-based, poorly-designed websites that don't do nearly enough to keep the public at large informed. They're simply unacceptably user-unfriendly. The proof of this is how rarely they're used (linked-to and discussed) even on more-or-less-niche political blogs, much less in casual political conversation.</p><p>More background: There's too much money in politics, and not enough full public transparency buttressed by strong ethics rules and comprehensive electoral reform. As a result, trust in government institutions like the U.S. Congress is trending ever-lower, and voting rates are unacceptably depressed. As public opinion agency Gallup put it in July, the \"2010 Confidence in Institutions poll finds Congress ranking dead last out of the 16 institutions rated this year. Eleven percent of Americans say they have 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in Congress, down from 17% in 2009 and a percentage point lower than the previous low for Congress, recorded in 2008.\"</p><p>If we were tasked with re-designing American democracy for the 21st century, we would revamp these arcane systems and bring them up to widely-accepted technical standards. Keeping in touch with your elected officials in government should be as easy as keeping in touch with friends on a social networking website such as, say, Facebook. There's no compelling reason why this should not be the case unless you're a stakeholder in the status quo -- a lobbyist or a political insider or an elected official who depends on the system remaining \"defective by design\". Looking ahead, open-source software and the Internet (and libre data and flexible copyright licenses) give us the tools we need to make all public data available to the public, immediately and in full. Such a radical degree of transparency is first necessary in order to restore public trust in government and increase civic engagement.</p><p>OpenGovernment is a first step towards a solution. In the shorter-term, OpenGovernment is basically a version of OpenCongress for state legislatures, in early open-source development. We cleaned-up the OpenCongress code base for OpenGovernment, bringing over some parts and writing lots of new code in Ruby on Rails, making it better-documented and more modular. We also simplified the web design and foregrounded more of our user-friendly participation tools along with our unique data offerings. We offer OpenGovernment to the public commons as a free, libre, and open-source model for open standards and future government transparency projects -- contributions warmly welcomed and remixes encouraged.</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Open Government", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/open-government", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "39\u00b0 38' 22.3368\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "188", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "102\u00b0 39' 22.5\" W", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2012-11-10T23:10:46", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2011-01-27T03:03:15", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "348", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Paris", "geo_country": "France", "content_country": "France", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.democratiedirecte.fr\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.democratiedirecte.fr\">Acting for Direct Democracy</a></p><p>(French association under Law July First1901)</p><p><a id=\"Mission_statement\" name=\"Mission_statement\"></a></p><h2>Mission statement</h2><p>(statutes article 2)</p><p>The association \u201cActing for direct democracy\u201d has for aim to reform the Constitution of the French Republic to introduce at local, regional and national level, devices of direct democracy, especially, the referendum and the popular initiative.

Le petit Liechtenstein la pratique aussi. Depuis 1970, le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d\u2019initiative populaire pour abroger une loi existe en Italie.

Le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum veto consiste \u00e0 permettre au peuple d\u2019annuler une loi vot\u00e9e par le parlement. Il faut une p\u00e9tition de citoyens, (50 000 en Suisse, 500 000 en Italie) qui demande l\u2019annulation de la loi. Si le nombre minimum de signatures est atteint, un d\u00e9bat est lanc\u00e9 et le r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum populaire a lieu environ six mois plus tard. Si le non l\u2019emporte, la loi est annul\u00e9e. Si le \u00ab\u00a0oui\u00a0\u00bb l\u2019emporte, la loi est confirm\u00e9e. C\u2019est un frein pour s\u2019assurer que les \u00e9lus ne votent pas une loi que la majorit\u00e9 des citoyens r\u00e9prouve, ce qui peut arriver compte tenu des puissants lobbies qui font aujourd\u2019hui pression sur le gouvernement ou le parlement. C\u2019est un moyen de redonner la parole aux citoyens non organis\u00e9s en lobbies, en groupes de pression.</p><p>L\u2019initiative populaire est une p\u00e9tition pour soumettre au r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum un projet de loi voulu par les citoyens signataires sur un sujet que le gouvernement ou le parlement ignorent ou ont peur d\u2019aborder. En Suisse, le chiffre pour qu\u2019une p\u00e9tition soit valable a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 \u00e0 100 000 signatures. Aux Etats-Unis, le chiffre \u00e0 atteindre est un pourcentage des \u00e9lecteurs, et il varie selon les Etats. Si le nombre de signatures est atteint, un d\u00e9bat est organis\u00e9 sur les medias et le parlement donne son avis sur le projet en question. Il peut aussi r\u00e9diger un contre-projet qui sera soumis le m\u00eame jour au r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum. Ainsi, le parlement n\u2019est nullement mis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart. La d\u00e9mocratie directe organise plut\u00f4t une saine concurrence entre les citoyens et les \u00e9lus pour faire les lois\u00a0: personne ne doit \u00eatre exclu alors que la d\u00e9mocratie repr\u00e9sentative pure exclut les citoyens de la fonction l\u00e9gislative.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Pratique\" name=\"Pratique\"></a></p><h2>Pratique</h2><p>La pratique varie beaucoup selon les Etats.

The history of the website and the software developed for it is recounted in this document.</p><p>The greatest strength of the system is that it uses the opinions of its users (crowd-sourceing) to evaluate the importance, quality and usefulness of the ideas/issues and also crowd-sources the selection of the best arguments/points for and against those ideas/issues. Thus enabling users to make up their minds about most issues in a very short time.</p><p>The software behind Skugga\u00feing, Skuggaborg and Betri Reykjav\u00edk is called Open Active Democracy (OAD). It has been in development since November 2008 and has gone through various versions.</p><p>The first version of Skugga\u00feing (which blends ideas and law proposals from users with the official proposals from the Icelandic Parliament) opened in January 2009, it\u2019s current version opened in February 2010 and Skuggaborg/Betri Reykjav\u00edk (ShadowCity/Better Reykjavik) in May 2010. In the beginning of 2010 the Open Source software Nationbuilder was merged with it and the name changed. The OAD software is Open Source and uses a Gnu license. The developers were awarded a 2 million IS kr\u00f3nur grant from the Icelandic Parliament.</p><p>We created a website for the unofficial Ministry of Ideas (Hugmyndar\u00e1\u00f0uneyti\u00f0), this website won the SVEF (the Icelandic Web Industry Association) Award in 2010 for the most original website. We have engaged in talks with interested authorities about using their own version of Better Reykjav\u00edk. We are now working with the City of Reykjavik on a new version of Better Reykjavik with a better user interface and integration with the administrative system. Proposed opening is in April 2011.</p><p>We were asked to develop a collaborative website for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the Icelandic application which will open in February 2011. The website is intended to ensure that all viewpoints regarding the application will be put forth and give the general public a chance to state their opinions.</p><p>Other current projects include a grant application website for the Ministry of Education where the grant appliers rate which projects should receive grants and an unofficial and pro-bono Stj\u00f3rnlaga\u00feing (Constitutional Assembly) website to give the public a platform to voice and grade their ideas for a new constitution. In March 2010 we started a collaboration with the Icelandic Prime Ministers Office to make data from the governments 20/20 project available for public crowd sourceing which will be opened as soon as the data is made available. We have established a non-profit organisation called <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.\u00edb\u00faar.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.\u00edb\u00faar.is/\">\u00cdb\u00faar.is</a> (Citizens) which will be responsible for our websites.

Vzpostavitev sistema za samostojne dr\u017eavljane</p><p>Stranka neposredne demokracije Svojpolitik.si se ustanovi z namenom, da se politi\u010dni sistem Republike Slovenije nadgradi na tak\u0161en na\u010din, da volivci na volitvah niso ve\u010d prisiljeni oddati svoj glas nekomu ali biti pasivni, temve\u010d lahko svoj glas obdr\u017eijo zase in se odlo\u010dajo ter oddajajo predloge preko za\u0161\u010ditenega elektronskega sistema (npr. preko certifikata SIGEN-CA). Volilni listi\u010di se zato spremenijo tako, da se na vpra\u0161anje:\u00a0\u00bbKoga bi volili?\u00ab, doda odgovor sebe. Ko volivec obkro\u017ei to mo\u017enost in na volilni listek dopi\u0161e \u0161e svoje ime in priimek ter EM\u0160O, s tem postane samostojen dr\u017eavljan, ki ima nato 1/\u0161tevilo volilnih upravi\u010dencev mo\u010di pri odlo\u010danju v predstavni\u0161kem organu, za katerega so bile razpisane volitve (velja za nacionalne in lokalne volitve, EU nivo je iz tega logi\u010dno izklju\u010den).</p><p>Za primer volitev v dr\u017eavni zbor 2008 je izra\u010dun slede\u010d. Volilnih upravi\u010dencev je bilo tedaj 1.696.437, \u010de to \u0161tevilo delimo z 90 poslanci, dobimo izra\u010dun, da vsak poslanec predstavlja 18849,3 volilnih upravi\u010dencev. Samostojni dr\u017eavljan bi v tem primeru upravljal z 1/1.696.437 procentom glasov, vsakemu poslancu pa bi se za 1/90 tega zneska zmanj\u0161a njegova mo\u010d glasovanja.</p><p>\u010ce dr\u017eavne institucije prepre\u010dijo sprejetje te bistvene to\u010dke programa, zahtevamo, da se razre\u0161i neustavno stanje, v katerega smo za\u0161li, in se 3. \u010dlen ustave, ki pravi, da ima v Sloveniji oblast ljudstvo, spremeni tako, da se zapi\u0161e, da ima v Sloveniji oblast ritualno voljena politi\u010dno/ekonomska oligarhija. Kajti v preteklosti je bila oblast ljudstva omejena s tem, da so fizi\u010dne oziroma naravne danosti omejevale neposredno odlo\u010danje dr\u017eavljanov. Danes, ko \u017ee na dr\u017eavnem nivoju priznavamo legalnost elektronskih podpisov pa teh naravnih omejitev ni ve\u010d. \u010ce je oblast res ljudska, morajo imeti dr\u017eavljani na izbiro vse realne mo\u017enosti upravljanja. Kajti, \u010de so ljudje nujno prisiljeni na volitvah predati svojo oblast in izbrati svojega vladarja, \u010deprav bi si lahko vladali sami, potem oblast ni ljudska, ampak gre tu za navadno diktaturo volitev, s tem pa je kr\u0161ena tudi pravica do samoodlo\u010dbe.</p><p>Ko se na lokalnem in nacionalnem nivoju vzpostavi delujo\u010d in s strani dr\u017eave podprt sistem namenjen samostojnim dr\u017eavljanom, se stranka neposredne demokracije Svojpolitik.si samoukine, ker ni ve\u010d smisla, da obstaja. To dolo\u010dilo je zapisano tudi v statutu stranke. <a id=\"B_.29_Sprejemanje_odlo.C4.8Ditev\" name=\"B_.29_Sprejemanje_odlo.C4.8Ditev\"></a></p><h2>B ) Sprejemanje odlo\u010ditev</h2><p>2.) Vse odlo\u010ditve se sprejemajo preko internetnega foruma</p><p>Druga pomembna to\u010dka programa je, da se vse odlo\u010ditve stranke Svojpolitik.si sprejemajo preko elektronsko za\u0161\u010ditenega internetnega foruma. Glede na razmerje glasov o dolo\u010denem predlogu (za ali proti) delegati stranke nato proporcionalno glasujejo v dr\u017eavnem zboru, mestnih ali ob\u010dinskih svetih. Svojpolitik.si se tako ne omejuje na dolo\u010den sklop politi\u010dno/ ekonomskih idej ampak slu\u017ei kot platforma za razli\u010dna mnenja, ki imajo tako mo\u017enost, da prepri\u010dajo ljudi o svoji pravilnosti. Zato je tudi v primerjavi z drugimi programi politi\u010dnih strank program Svojpolitik.si zelo kratek. Skratka pri te obliki demokrati\u010dne organizacije gre predvsem za mehanizem odlo\u010danja in ne za nek specifi\u010dno zapisan program, ki bi ga bilo potrebno skorajda sveto zagovarjati. Program oziroma programi in odlo\u010ditve so zato dinami\u010dne in o njih se odlo\u010da preko spletnega foruma. Poskrbeli pa bomo, da bo na spletni strani dovolj razli\u010dnih predlogov, za katere bo mogo\u010de glasovati.</p><p>Poleg teh dveh bistvenih to\u010dk programa pa v Svojpolitik.si predlagamo \u0161e nekaj dodatnih izhodi\u0161\u010d, ki bi slu\u017eila kot oja\u010ditev sistema neposredne demokracije.</p><p>3.) Osredoto\u010denost na trajnostni razvoj</p><p>Ker je Zemlja ena sama in smatramo, da jo je dobro ohraniti tudi za prihodnje rodove, bomo posku\u0161ali spodbujati re\u0161itve, ki ne slonijo na destrukciji dru\u017ebenega in naravnega okolja. <a id=\"C.29_Ukinitev_nedemokrati.C4.8Dnih_in_pol-demokrati.C4.8Dnih_sistemskih_prvin\" name=\"C.29_Ukinitev_nedemokrati.C4.8Dnih_in_pol-demokrati.C4.8Dnih_sistemskih_prvin\"></a></p><h2>C) Ukinitev nedemokrati\u010dnih in pol-demokrati\u010dnih sistemskih prvin</h2><p>4.) Ukinitev dr\u017eavnega sveta</p><p>Njegova funkcija in obstoj je dedi\u0161\u010dina politi\u010dnega sistema SFRJ, kjer je imela tak\u0161na institucija svoj smisel, danes pa predstavlja le izkrivljenost demokrati\u010dne forme in na\u010dela \"en \u010dlovek en glas\" ter nepotrebne stro\u0161ke. Interesnim skupinam pa bi tako ali tako \u0161e vedno ostala mo\u017enost vpliva na odlo\u010devalce preko lobiranja.</p><p>5.) Sprememba zakona o poslancih</p><p>Zakon o poslancih bi bilo potrebno spremeniti tako, da bi po novem poslancu prenehal mandat, \u010de ne bi upo\u0161teval volje ljudstva. To bi veljalo le za poslance, ki delujejo v organizacijah, kjer je njihovo delovanje vezano na neposredno demokracijo. Nezaupnico oziroma zaupnico poslancu bi se izglasovalo preko e-glasovanja.</p><p>6.) Ukinitev volilnega praga</p><p>Zakon o volitvah v dr\u017eavni zbor se spremeni tako, da se ukine sedaj veljavno pravilo, da mora politi\u010dna stranka dose\u010di minimalno 4% glasov, da se uvrsti v dr\u017eavni zbor. S tem pravilom je zelo ote\u017eko\u010den razvoj novih strank, ker volivci nimajo prakti\u010dno nobene motivacije, da bi volili manj\u0161e in nove politi\u010dne stranke. Kajti \u010de njihova stranka ne dose\u017ee 4% praga, je kot da ne bi glasovali, ker se njihovi glasovi prakti\u010dno izbri\u0161ejo. S tem pa tudi ostanejo brez svojega predstavnika ljudstva, ki bi jim moral pripadati. Z ukinitvijo tega pravila bi v Sloveniji dobili bolj dinami\u010den in bolj demokrati\u010den politi\u010dni sistem, ki bi prevetril dana\u0161njo okostenelo strankarsko sceno.</p><p>7.) Ukinitev praga za financiranje politi\u010dnih strank iz prora\u010duna</p><p>Zakon o politi\u010dnih strankah se spremeni tako, da se ukine omejitev, ki pravi, da mora politi\u010dna stranka dose\u010di minimalno 1% glasov volivcev, da ima pravico do financiranja iz dr\u017eavnega prora\u010duna. Na ta na\u010din bi vzpodbudili delovanje manj\u0161ih strank in posledi\u010dno delovanje opozicije. <a id=\"D.29_Tehni.C4.8Dna_podpora_sistemu_neposredne_demokracije\" name=\"D.29_Tehni.C4.8Dna_podpora_sistemu_neposredne_demokracije\"></a></p><h2>D) Tehni\u010dna podpora sistemu neposredne demokracije</h2><p>8.) Spremembe v delovanju digitalnih potrdil SIGEN-CA</p><p>Digitalna potrdila SIGEN-CA se spremenijo tako, da je iz njih razvidno ali ima oseba volilno pravico, doda se tudi EM\u0160O imetnika potrdila, ob morebitni smrti imetnika potrdila le to nemudoma preneha veljati. Poleg tega se doda tudi mo\u017enost, da lahko preko SIGEN-CA potrdila elektronsko pooblastite tretjo osebo, da lahko preveri va\u0161e osebne podatke zbrane v centralnem registru prebivalstva. S temi spremembami pisno po\u0161iljanje vlog preko klasi\u010dne po\u0161te ne bi bilo ve\u010d potrebno, bistveno pa bi bil hitrej\u0161i tudi celotni postopek registracije na forumu Svojpolitik.si.</p><p>9.) Uvedba e-volitev in e-referendumov</p><p>Uvedba elektronskih volitev na lokalnem nivoju in v dr\u017eavni zbor ter uvedba elektronskih referendumov. Ve\u010dkrat \u017ee obljubljeno, nikoli realizirano.</p><p>10.) Brezpla\u010den internetni dostop za vse dr\u017eavljane</p><p>Ker verjamemo, da je pravica komunicirati osnovna \u010dlovekova pravica in je ideja Svojpolitik.si vezana na internetni dostop, bi v okviru dr\u017eave organizirali brezpla\u010dni osnovni dostop do interneta (npr. ADSL) za vse dr\u017eavljane.</p><p>11.) Dr\u017eavna shema za nakup ra\u010dunalnika Iz podobnih razlogov bi dr\u017eava financirala shemo za ugoden nakup osebnih ra\u010dunalnikov.</p><p>12.) Ustanovitev centrov za glasovanje</p><p>Ustanovili bi se tudi posebni centri za glasovanje z dostopom do ra\u010dunalnikov in interneta, ki bi bili locirani v prostorih ob\u010din ali \u010detrtnih skupnosti. <a id=\"Direct_Democracy_organisations\" name=\"Direct_Democracy_organisations\"></a></p><h2>Direct Democracy organisations</h2><p><a href=\"/methods/direct-democracy\" title=\"Direct Democracy\">Direct_Democracy</a> organisations present on Participedia</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Svojpolitik.si", "methods": "Direct Democracy", "path": "/organizations/svojpolitiksi", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "45\u00b0 58' 52.2696\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "188", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "14\u00b0 46' 0.8652\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2012-07-03T12:41:35", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "104 Rue du Plein Soleil", "executive_director": "Pierre-Yves Guih\u00e9neuf and Alexandra Villaroel", "post_date": "2011-06-06T15:07:24", "other_images": "[\"comedie.jpg\"]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "34980", "id": "361", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Saint G\u00e9ly du Fesc and Paris France", "geo_country": "France", "content_country": "France", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Environment||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<p>Com\u00e9die (Concertation, mediation, environment) is a program created by two associations: Geyser and AFIP, with the support of the Foundation of France.

(TAC) is a functional community organization that emerges in 1989 in the Cerro Cordillera, Valpara\u00edso.</p><p>Its fundamental objective is to promote community development, form the generation of new practices in the territory to help improve environmental conditions such as neighborhood relations between the people who inhabit it. The meaning of the action of the organization in the territory is synthesized in five key ideas, namely: meeting of actors, opportunities for participation, concrete action new practice in the territory and strengthen community bonds and collective senses.</p><p>The effect generated by each of these ideas is the change in relationships, the reappropriation of space, to make visible the collective capabilities, value the everyday space generating material transformations of meaning and densification of the civil society from local.</p><p>RESUMEN</p><p>El taller de Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria (TAC), es una organizaci\u00f3n comunitaria funcional que surge el a\u00f1o 1989 en el cerro Cordillera, Valpara\u00edso.</p><p>Su objetivo fundamental es promover el desarrollo comunitario, a partir de la generaci\u00f3n de nuevas pr\u00e1cticas en el territorio que contribuyan a mejorar las condiciones del entorno barrial como las relaciones entre las personas que lo habitan.</p><p>El sentido de la acci\u00f3n de la organizaci\u00f3n en el territorio se sintetiza en cinco ideas fundamentales, \u00e9stas son: encuentro de actores, oportunidad de participaci\u00f3n, acci\u00f3n concreta, nuevas pr\u00e1cticas en el territorio y fortalecimiento de v\u00ednculos comunitarios y sentidos colectivos. El efecto que genera cada una de estas ideas es el cambio en las relaciones, la reapropiaci\u00f3n de los espacios, hacer visible las capacidades colectivas, valorar el espacio cotidiano generando transformaciones materiales, de sentido y densificaci\u00f3n de la sociedad civil desde lo local.</p><p>PROP\u00d3SITO Y PROBLEMA</p><p>El cerro Cordillera, a la altura del Camino Cintura fue uno de los primeros asentamientos populares de Valpara\u00edso, esta localidad se destaca por su profunda tradici\u00f3n portuaria, de organizaci\u00f3n sindical y obrera.</p><p>En estas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas el cerro se ha ido empobreciendo por el envejecimiento de sus habitantes, la cesant\u00eda de la juventud y la prevalencia del consumo de drogas (SUBDERE, CIC &amp; GTZ., 2008).</p><p>Los problemas identificados por la localidad en sus inicios ten\u00edan relaci\u00f3n principalmente con el deterioro e inexistencia de espacios p\u00fablicos, la presencia de basurales en quebradas, con un alto d\u00e9ficit sanitario y de infecciones en la comunidad. Dentro de los aspectos sociales exist\u00eda baja participaci\u00f3n y desconfianzas en los l\u00edderes existentes.</p><p>Las condiciones de empleo y habitabilidad eran deficientes, as\u00ed como la falta de equipamiento e infraestructura comunitaria (Fundaci\u00f3n H\u00e1bitat Colombia, 2005).</p><p>En este escenario, en el a\u00f1o 1998, un grupo de socios fundadores del Taller de Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria (TAC), recorrieron distintos cerros de Valpara\u00edso, buscando un espacio con vida barrial donde generar un proyecto de desarrollo local, con el objetivo de reconstruir los v\u00ednculos comunitarios y mejorar las condiciones de vida de sus habitantes. En este sentido el cerro Cordillera cumpl\u00eda con dichos potenciales, en cuanto a su trayectoria hist\u00f3rica, y presencia de diversas organizaciones sociales e instituciones locales que podr\u00edan participar de la iniciativa, adem\u00e1s sus habitantes ten\u00edan nivel de necesidades b\u00e1sicas cubiertas. Esto \u00faltimo permit\u00eda generar un proyecto enfocado en el desarrollo comunitario y no asistencialista.</p><p>Desde sus inicios su prop\u00f3sito fue promover el desarrollo comunitario, a trav\u00e9s de la participaci\u00f3n en iniciativas concretas de incidencia local, su modelo de intervenci\u00f3n parte de la base de la educaci\u00f3n, capacitaci\u00f3n formal o informal sobre salud, medio ambiente, mercado, cultura. Este desarrollo integral comprende la mejora material del h\u00e1bitat y del entorno barrial. Su trabajo est\u00e1 dirigido a ni\u00f1os, j\u00f3venes, mujeres, adultos, tercera edad, vecinos, organizaciones, instituciones funcionales y/o Territoriales (Revista TAC, 2009).</p><p>Sus l\u00edneas de acci\u00f3n son las siguientes (SUBDERE, CIC &amp; GTZ., 2008):</p><p>1) Articulaci\u00f3n de la red Local y Comunal a trav\u00e9s de generar relaciones asociativas entre distintas organizaciones, ampliando la visi\u00f3n del territorio a partir de compartir e intercambiar aprendizajes.</p><p>2) Acciones de prevenci\u00f3n en ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes por medio de talleres que promueven el buen uso del tiempo libre en acciones concretas de mejoramiento y recuperaci\u00f3n del entorno f\u00edsico y social.</p><p>3) Educaci\u00f3n y mejoramiento ambiental, ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes se constituyen como agentes en el proceso de recuperaci\u00f3n y transformaci\u00f3n de espacios desde una metodolog\u00eda de educaci\u00f3n en la acci\u00f3n.</p><p>4) Acci\u00f3n cultural, articulando los espacios de expresi\u00f3n y difusi\u00f3n de cultura en los cerros a trav\u00e9s de la creaci\u00f3n de murales.</p><p>5) Rescate de la identidad local, se trabaja desde talleres, recuperaci\u00f3n y restauraci\u00f3n de hitos patrimoniales orientados a rescatar y valorar el patrimonio tangible e intangible, fortaleciendo y reconociendo la construcci\u00f3n de la historia que los constituye.</p><p>6) Recuperaci\u00f3n y mejoramiento de espacios p\u00fablicos, esta l\u00ednea de acci\u00f3n se ha ido consolidando en el tiempo a trav\u00e9s de ir conquistando nuevos espacios para el uso p\u00fablico (basurales, sitios eriazos, estacionamientos).</p><p>7) Biblioteca comunitaria, se promueve el uso del tiempo libre en espacios orientados a la cultura y tecnolog\u00eda.</p><p>8) Fortalecimiento de la acci\u00f3n voluntaria, a trav\u00e9s del ejercicio ciudadano basado en el desarrollo local, la autogesti\u00f3n y la responsabilidad c\u00edvica. Actualmente se conforma una red de voluntarios provenientes de la misma localidad, de universidades y extranjeros.</p><p>9) Extensi\u00f3n, se promueve el intercambio de experiencias y aprendizajes con otras iniciativas mediantes ferias, pasant\u00edas, seminarios, foros y visitas educativas a nivel local, comunal, regional, nacional e internacional.</p><p>El prop\u00f3sito y las l\u00edneas de acci\u00f3n del TAC, se concretan en un espacio educativo complementario al formal, focalizado principalmente en ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes a trav\u00e9s de tres instancias:</p><p>1) Programa Integral: talleres estables que se constituyen en sesiones semanales de trabajo con cursos de los diversos establecimientos participantes, dirigidos a ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes entre 3 y 25 a\u00f1os, correspondientes a escuelas b\u00e1sicas, especiales e integradas y jardines infantiles.</p><p>En estas sesiones se abordan diversas tem\u00e1ticas, las cuales se vinculan a las problem\u00e1ticas e inquietudes surgidas en el \u00e1mbito de la educaci\u00f3n formal.</p><p>Las actividades se desarrollan en horario de clases, formando parte del curr\u00edculo acad\u00e9mico de los establecimientos. Cada curso asiste al TAC una vez por semana y la jornada de trabajo tiene una duraci\u00f3n de una hora y media.</p><p>2) Escuelas de temporada: Corresponden a diversos talleres que se desarrollan simult\u00e1neamente por per\u00edodos de 4 a 12 d\u00edas consecutivos, normalmente se realizan en per\u00edodo de vacaciones de invierno y verano, y est\u00e1n dirigidos a ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes entre 5 y 25 a\u00f1os, de escuelas asociadas a la red, de la comunidad local y extralocal.</p><p>La jornada diaria de trabajo se extiende desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 4:30 de la tarde, incluyendo un espacio para el desayuno, almuerzo y colaci\u00f3n.</p><p>3) Talleres tem\u00e1ticos: esta estrategia se orienta al desarrollo de talleres asociados a tem\u00e1ticas espec\u00edficas, cuya implementaci\u00f3n es ocasional. La duraci\u00f3n de los talleres se define en base a una cantidad pertinentes de sesiones consensuadas entre los actores participantes, entre los que se encuentran ni\u00f1os, j\u00f3venes de las escuelas asociadas a la red, adultos en general, mujeres, tercera edad, dirigentes de organizaciones sociales y territoriales (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).</p><p>HISTORIA</p><p>Los inicios del TAC se remontan hacia el a\u00f1o 1989 per\u00edodo en el cual constitu\u00eda un programa de trabajo de la ONG CECAP (Centro de Capacitaci\u00f3n y asesor\u00eda Poblacional), la cual estaba orientada a promover el desarrollo de la vida comunitaria en localidades pobres de la ciudad de Valpara\u00edso (Revista TAC, 2009).</p><p>En una primera etapa su trabajo en el cerro Cordillera se orient\u00f3 al desarrollo de un autodiagn\u00f3stico, donde participaron dirigentes, pobladores y organizaciones de base para identificar las fortalezas y debilidades del barrio. Dentro de la prioridades a trabajar se reconocen: generar condiciones que faciliten el encuentro y participaci\u00f3n en el proceso de desarrollo local, demostrar en acciones concretas en el territorio posibilidades de transformaci\u00f3n, reconocer y valorar el espacio local (Biblioteca CF+S, 2006).</p><p>En el a\u00f1o 1990 la organizaci\u00f3n se emplaza en una quebrada de Cordillera convertida en basural por m\u00e1s de 40 a\u00f1os, se inician jornadas de limpiezas donde se invita a participar a la comunidad. Una vez recuperada, se consolida la primera plaza y se realizan los primeros murales inspirados en la historia local.</p><p>Este per\u00edodo fue b\u00e1sico para generar confianzas mutuas, entre la organizaci\u00f3n, dirigentes vecinales, organismos locales y escuelas del sector (Revista TAC, 2009).</p><p>En la d\u00e9cada del 90 la mayor\u00eda de organizaciones no gubernamentales del pa\u00eds comenzaron a recibir una disminuci\u00f3n de recursos financieros, a pesar de ello el TAC sigue adelante y decide convertirse en una instituci\u00f3n aut\u00f3noma de CECAP, a partir de lo cual el trabajo comienza a sostenerse en la Asociatividad y la participaci\u00f3n local, destac\u00e1ndose la labor y permanencia del equipo fundador de la iniciativa. Desde este a\u00f1o la organizaci\u00f3n se comienza a sustentar a trav\u00e9s de la acci\u00f3n voluntaria y proyectos puntuales, este cambio de funcionamiento sienta las bases que le han dado sostenibilidad en el tiempo (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).</p><p>En este per\u00edodo la estrategia es coordinarse con los actores en torno al territorio, recuperando los espacios f\u00edsicos a trav\u00e9s de reuniones de planificaci\u00f3n y conocimiento mutuo. El fortalecimiento del sentido comunitario, toma un rol central a partir de la articulaci\u00f3n de organizaciones locales, establecimientos educacionales y el consultorio de salud (Biblioteca CF+S, 2006).</p><p>Entre 1996 y 1998, se consideran como los a\u00f1os de consolidaci\u00f3n del proyecto y proyecci\u00f3n del TAC, se inicia un proceso de sistematizaci\u00f3n de la experiencia y se comienza a trabajar en la difusi\u00f3n del trabajo realizado a escala local y comunal mediante afiches, boletines, v\u00ednculos con la prensa y talleres estables con los establecimientos educacionales de la comuna.</p><p>A finales de esta etapa se termina de construir el anfiteatro en la quebrada recuperada, donde se consolida un espacio colectivo y local para la cultura capaz de albergar a 600 personas, participan m\u00e1s de 1000 personas en su construcci\u00f3n.</p><p>La cuarta etapa que va del a\u00f1o 1999 al 2001, se reconoce como el per\u00edodo donde ya existe una legitimaci\u00f3n del modelo intervenci\u00f3n. La organizaci\u00f3n se preocupa de la construcci\u00f3n de medios de difusi\u00f3n y material educativo, se desarrollan pasant\u00edas y encuentros con distintos actores del territorio. A finales de este ciclo se realiza la 31 escuela de verano, donde la mayor\u00eda de j\u00f3venes de cordillera, antiguos ni\u00f1os pasan a ser monitores, este hito es importante de mencionar, ya que estos j\u00f3venes son los que comienzan a organizarse y generar cambios significativos en el territorio posteriormente (Revista TAC, 2009).</p><p>Este \u00faltimo per\u00edodo, desde el a\u00f1o 2002 al 2009, ha estado centrado en la revisi\u00f3n de lo realizado y en el trabajo de replicar el modelo de intervenci\u00f3n en \u00e1mbitos acad\u00e9micos, p\u00fablicos y otras realidades locales.</p><p>Los actores principales han sido los ni\u00f1os, j\u00f3venes, voluntarios, la red cordillera, universidades y organismos p\u00fablicos.</p><p>La gesti\u00f3n de recursos en este \u00faltimo per\u00edodo ha sido mediante proyectos, acci\u00f3n voluntaria, participaci\u00f3n local, asociativismo, desarrollo de convenios de cooperaci\u00f3n con universidades nacionales, extranjeras y organismos p\u00fablicos (Revista TAC, 2009).</p><p>CREACI\u00d3N Y SELECCI\u00d3N DE PARTICIPANTES</p><p>La sostenibilidad de esta experiencia est\u00e1 dada por su modelo de intervenci\u00f3n que se basa en una estructura asociativa a trav\u00e9s de la red Cordillera conformada por distintas organizaciones que representan distintos \u00e1mbitos del territorio.</p><p>Una vez que el TAC se asienta en Cordillera impulsa la articulaci\u00f3n y coordinaci\u00f3n de estas organizaciones ya existentes. Esta plataforma ha sido estrat\u00e9gica para el empoderamiento local, vinculaci\u00f3n de actores y retroalimentaci\u00f3n con el entorno, guiando el quehacer hacia la visi\u00f3n de un desarrollo comunitario dise\u00f1ado y concretado en conjunto.</p><p>La figura organizacional del Taller de Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria se estructura de tres niveles; el directorio encargado de entregar lineamientos estrat\u00e9gicos generales, tanto para la labor educativa como para la gesti\u00f3n; el equipo central, responsable de dise\u00f1ar el trabajo educativo con las escuelas y las labores de gesti\u00f3n; y el equipo de trabajo en terreno, encargado de planificar las actividades concretas a realizar en cada sesi\u00f3n de trabajo con las escuelas.</p><p>La estructura de la red la podemos entender desde distintas esferas de participaci\u00f3n. En su centro identificamos al TAC como agente vinculador de la red, articul\u00e1ndose en una primera esfera de participaci\u00f3n local, constituida por organizaciones m\u00e1s activas dentro de la planificaci\u00f3n y toma de decisiones en el territorio, entre ellas identificamos a la Poblaci\u00f3n obrera de la Uni\u00f3n, la Cruz Roja, voluntarios locales, consultorio, parroquia y 12 escuelas p\u00fablicas. Incorporando tambi\u00e9n a organizaciones perif\u00e9ricas como los clubes deportivos, carabineros, centro de madres y las distintas juntas de vecinos (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).</p><p>En una segunda esfera de participaci\u00f3n identificamos a los actores extralocales constituidos por las empresas colaboradoras, voluntarios, servicios p\u00fablicos y universidades asociadas(Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).</p><p>Como actores protagonistas se reconoce a los ni\u00f1os, j\u00f3venes y voluntarios, los cuales son participantes constantes, desde el programa integral que se realiza durante todo el a\u00f1o con las escuelas asociadas y los talleres impartidos en las escuelas de verano e invierno.</p><p>En cuanto a la selecci\u00f3n de participantes identificamos 4 categor\u00edas: autoselecci\u00f3n, m\u00e1s bien selecci\u00f3n natural en el caso de los voluntarios, los cuales se involucran y adquieren responsabilidades seg\u00fan su nivel de compromiso y disponibilidad de tiempo. En el caso de reclutamiento dirigido identificamos a los cursos de las escuelas seleccionadas para participar durante el a\u00f1o en el programa integral que imparte el TAC, en tercer lugar est\u00e1n los stakeholders, constituidos por los l\u00edderes de las organizaciones sociales, que participan activamente dentro de la red. Por \u00faltimo, dentro de la segunda esfera de participaci\u00f3n se ubican los grupos de inter\u00e9s profesional conformados por ONG, organizaciones p\u00fablicas y privados que participan de mesas t\u00e9cnicas, ferias, pasant\u00edas y seminarios, los cuales siempre participan de manera voluntaria, sin ser remunerados.</p><p>DELIBERACIONES, DECISIONES E INTERACCIONES P\u00daBLICAS</p><p>Para colocar en contexto los mecanismos utilizados en la toma de decisiones promovidas por la visi\u00f3n del TAC, es importante exponer la metodolog\u00eda de acci\u00f3n local que ha desarrollado en estos 21 a\u00f1os la organizaci\u00f3n y que ha estado impulsada desde tres perspectivas de trabajo en el territorio.</p><p>En primer lugar la Asociatividad, mediante el intercambio de experiencias, horizontalidad, flexibilidad y permanencia en el tiempo de la red Cordillera. Los v\u00ednculos asociativos entre las distintas organizaciones ha permitido movilizar recursos locales (f\u00edsicos y humanos principalmente).</p><p>Segundo, la participaci\u00f3n local de las distintas organizaciones y voluntarios construyen de manera conjunta las estrategias, planes, proyectos y acciones. Esto ha permitido en el tiempo una fuerte apropiaci\u00f3n de los espacios ganados, fortaleciendo los lazos comunitarios y relaciones de sociabilidad con actores externos a la comunidad (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).</p><p>En este contexto identificamos el tipo de participaci\u00f3n en el nivel de asociaciones de co-gesti\u00f3n o m\u00e1s bien de co-construcci\u00f3n, ya que esta iniciativa ha fortalecido los v\u00ednculos y el capital social de la localidad, constituyendo nuevos l\u00edderes y nuevas formas de organizaci\u00f3n.</p><p>La interacci\u00f3n entre los participantes y la toma de decisiones es deliberativa y de suma de preferencias, es decir el modo de comunicaci\u00f3n es a trav\u00e9s del intercambio de visiones, informaci\u00f3n y aprendizajes, se busca llegar a acuerdo basado en argumentaciones y consensuados mediante una participaci\u00f3n colectiva.</p><p>El estilo de direcci\u00f3n del TAC promueve un liderazgo democr\u00e1tico, transformacional y participativo generando sentido de pertenencia y v\u00ednculos humanos.</p><p>Los espacios de participaci\u00f3n se han ido consolidando en el tiempo, a trav\u00e9s de asambleas, mesas de trabajo, talleres, donde los actores protagonistas son ciudadanos en general, autoridades p\u00fablicas, l\u00edderes comunitarios, voluntarios, ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes.</p><p>En t\u00e9rminos generales es posible identificar un proceso de toma de decisiones que contempla diferentes fases, que se ha denominado \u201creflexi\u00f3n en la acci\u00f3n\u201d. Esta metodolog\u00eda se estructura en esta secuencia: convocatoria de diversos actores de la localidad para participar de diagn\u00f3sticos participativos, identificando problemas, oportunidades y desaf\u00edos de trabajo, con este material se elaboran de manera conjunta las propuestas. La segunda fase se constituye por la gesti\u00f3n de recursos locales para implementar las acciones propuestas, que en la mayor\u00eda de los casos es a partir de la autogesti\u00f3n, posteriormente se implementan las acciones y por \u00faltimo, se eval\u00faa el proceso y sentido de la experiencia (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).</p><p>La interacci\u00f3n p\u00fablica se da en espacios de di\u00e1logo incluso m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo local, a trav\u00e9s de seminarios, pasant\u00edas, ferias, donde el TAC es representado a trav\u00e9s de sus voluntarios locales y extra locales seg\u00fan las tem\u00e1ticas que contemplan dicho espacios de encuentro. En \u00e9stos participan distintos actores de la sociedad civil, organizaciones y autoridades p\u00fablicas.</p><p>Otra forma de interacci\u00f3n p\u00fablica ha resultado ser el reconocimiento p\u00fablico de la experiencia, a trav\u00e9s de los premios que ha obtenido tanto a nivel local, nacional e internacional. Entre los m\u00e1s destacados se encuentra el primer lugar regional en medio ambiente por la Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Medio Ambiente de Chile; reconocimiento Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas Urbanas 2002 por el Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo Chile, premio a la Innovaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1rea ambiental 2002 por la Fundaci\u00f3n Ford Internacional, entre otros.</p><p>RESULTADOS Y EFECTOS</p><p>Los resultados y efectos del trabajo realizado por el TAC en el territorio ser\u00e1n presentados desde 3 dimensiones, en primer lugar desde un punto de vista cuantitativo, segundo cualitativo y por \u00faltimo, se expondr\u00e1 un caso concreto que muestra la replicabilidad de la experiencia.</p><p>Resultados cuantitativos:'</p><p>- Actualmente existen m\u00e1s de 40 organizaciones asociadas a la red Cordillera. Entre ellas: 12 escuelas p\u00fablicas y subvencionadas: comunes, integradas y especiales; y 10 universidades e instituciones extranjeras. (Sitio WEB TAC).

Desde sus inicios sus habitantes fueron familias de obreros portuarios, cuyos descendientes a\u00fan viven ah\u00ed. (Castillo, 2009). En el a\u00f1o 2005 recibi\u00f3 el sello bicentenario, formalizando su condici\u00f3n de edificio patrimonial.</p><p>Esta iniciativa se remonta al a\u00f1o 1998, cuando los j\u00f3venes residentes del edificio deciden liderar la directiva de la poblaci\u00f3n obrera, conform\u00e1ndose como organizaci\u00f3n comunitaria con el objetivo de iniciar un trabajo de recuperaci\u00f3n del edificio impulsado desde la autogesti\u00f3n. La primera intervenci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 a partir de fondos propios generados por actividades promovidas por la misma comunidad, en una segunda instancia se coordinan con el programa Proempleo (programa municipal de generaci\u00f3n de empleo local) y reciben fondos estatales, donde logran contratar a los mismos vecinos para iniciar la recuperaci\u00f3n del edificio (Ciudad de Valpara\u00edso).</p><p>En el a\u00f1o 2003, a trav\u00e9s de una iniciativa del TAC se crea una \u201cmesa t\u00e9cnica\u201d donde se invita a participar a vecinos, l\u00edderes barriales, y organismos p\u00fablicos, para abordar el desaf\u00edo de la recuperaci\u00f3n del edificio. Este hito inicia un proceso de formalizaci\u00f3n del trabajo desde la misma organizaci\u00f3n comunitaria, regularizando y saneando los t\u00edtulos de propiedad que se ven\u00eda llevando a cabo desde hace d\u00e9cadas, tarea importante de resolver para acceder a fondos p\u00fablicos. En este per\u00edodo se conforman como entidad organizadora y de asistencia t\u00e9cnica para poder postular al Fondo Solidario de Vivienda con el objetivo de llevar a cabo la rehabilitaci\u00f3n formal del edificio. Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde obtienen los subsidios de vivienda (Entrevista a Cristian Amarales).</p><p>La poblaci\u00f3n obrera fue protagonista en el desarrollo del proyecto de principio a fin, la directiva fue la encargada de elegir a los arquitectos y constructoras.</p><p>El edificio conserva su dise\u00f1o original, sus modificaciones son al interior de \u00e9ste, en cuanto a restablecer la subdivisi\u00f3n de departamentos para las 34 familias residentes, donde se consideraron ba\u00f1o y cocina independiente para cada uno de ellos, a diferencia de su dise\u00f1o inicial en el cual compart\u00edan servicio en el patio central, lo que gener\u00f3 un cambio sustancial en la forma de vida de las familias. El promedio de superficies de departamentos es entre 55 y 90 mts2 lo que supera los est\u00e1ndares m\u00ednimos de vivienda social que actualmente se construyen en el pa\u00eds.</p><p>Este proyecto recibi\u00f3 financiamiento del MINVU, y fondos generados a partir de la autogesti\u00f3n de la organizaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de la Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, propietarios y ValpoM\u00edo.</p><p>Actualmente los j\u00f3venes que lideraron este proceso, se organizan como corporaci\u00f3n junto a una red de organizaciones para recuperar la Capilla Santa Ana y posteriormente el ascensor de Cordillera. Su visi\u00f3n es demostrar que el trabajo a partir de la articulaci\u00f3n de actores y mesas t\u00e9cnicas es un medio para recuperar nuestro territorio, como menciona Cristi\u00e1n Amarales, l\u00edder y uno de los gestores de la iniciativa \u201c\u2026el desaf\u00edo es construir un nuevo modelo de pol\u00edtica p\u00fablica, replicable para otras experiencias\u2026\u201d.</p><p>Esta forma de hacer desarrollo local es un aprendizaje aprehendido en la experiencia vivida en el TAC.</p><p>AN\u00c1LISIS Y CR\u00cdTICA</p><p>Con respecto al an\u00e1lisis de la experiencia estudiada podemos decir que una estrategia clave para lograr la reconstrucci\u00f3n del tejido social del territorio fue la Asociatividad promovida por el TAC, a partir de la articulaci\u00f3n de las organizaciones existentes en la localidad, conformando la red Cordillera, como plataforma de acci\u00f3n y agentes de transformaci\u00f3n. Los v\u00ednculos asociativos re\u00fanen diversidad de miradas, aprendizajes, capacidades, esfuerzos y recursos para alcanzar los objetivos comunes propuestos.</p><p>Se reconoce que uno de los principales logros de la organizaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 vinculada a la pertinencia del proyecto. El TAC surge desde la identificaci\u00f3n de necesidades y problemas diagnosticados por sus propios habitantes y se ha ido construyendo al ritmo de los procesos locales, las propuestas de mejoramiento han sido realizadas por sus propios actores, a partir de la construcci\u00f3n de espacios de participaci\u00f3n colectiva que han ido fortaleciendo las confianzas y capacidades locales.</p><p>La metodolog\u00eda de trabajo del TAC a instaurado nuevas pr\u00e1cticas sociales que se han ido replicando en otras organizaciones, entre ellas la Asociatividad, la autogesti\u00f3n local, y la forma de tomar decisiones participativas y darle sentido a la acci\u00f3n conjunta a partir de \u201creflexionar en la acci\u00f3n\u201d.</p><p>Desde esta perspectiva la sostenibilidad de la experiencia va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo l\u00edmites de la organizaci\u00f3n, es decir que los aprendizajes pasan a ser un conocimiento colectivo, que pueden ser aplicables a otras iniciativas de diferentes escalas.</p><p>Un valor central de la experiencia estudiada es su capacidad para generar espacios y contextos de integraci\u00f3n social en el amplia sentido (diversidad de oficios, profesiones, culturas, lugar de origen) impactando m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la escala local, constituy\u00e9ndose en una iniciativa transformadora tanto de personas y de pr\u00e1cticas sociales a trav\u00e9s de la experiencia de sumarse y ser parte con otros en un proyecto colectivo que concreta sue\u00f1os comunitarios... En palabras del TAC \u201cUn espacio de realidades y Sue\u00f1os\u201d donde \u201cJuntos se construye una vida mejor\u201d.</p><p>Dentro de las debilidades de la experiencia se reconoce la disponibilidad de los recursos econ\u00f3micos que muchas veces son insuficientes y variables para la envergadura de la intervenci\u00f3n (observatorio latinoamericano, 2004). Estas problem\u00e1ticas se logran superar gracias a la capacidad de autogesti\u00f3n en que opera la organizaci\u00f3n, como tambi\u00e9n por el apoyo recibido por actores vinculados a la red.</p><p>BIBLIOGRAF\u00cdA</p><p>Biblioteca CF+S.

It promotes the coordination, the exchange and the sharing of research work that each associated Partner and laboratory undertakes.</p><p>The Group thus constitutes the favourite tool for dialog between the community of social scientists (at CNRS, IFSTTAR, IRSTEA, CIRAD), the institutions and companies that have to implement public participation in decision-making processes (the French Ministry of Ecology, Energy, and Sustainable Development, ADEME, the French Environment and Energy Management Agency; CNDP, the National Commission of Public Debate; SNCF R\u00e9seau, the National Rail Network; RTE, the French Electricity Transport Network, EDF Inc., the French Electricity Board), and the civil society.</p><p>The Group focuses on citizens' contribution, beyond their usual involvement in the institutional political life, to choices about society \u2014 sustainable development, social equality, redistribution and solidarity, public engagement with science, freedoms and civil rights, local and metropolitan issues, globalisation, etc. The Group studies their discussion in multiple civic spaces and the public policies implementation of these citizens inputs. Its research work covers all the fields where collective movements meet processes of institutionalization aiming at the inclusion of the citizens in the working-out and the implementation of public action and decision: democracy in social, health and technical issues, opening expertise to public participation, local democracy and community management, public interest and dialogs led at various territorial scales in multiple fields (public utilities, risks, food, school, social policies, environmental health, etc).</p><p>The number of laboratories which joined the Group (more than 50) and the success of the first doctoral days on participatory democracy and public participation in decision-making illustrate the vitality of the research field in France, its opening set of themes and scientific disciplines. The GIS Science Committee defined a set of activities which seeks to apprehend the multiplicity of participative experiments arising all trough the world. They aim at giving an account of their emergence in varied political situations, and of their adaptation to differentiated decision-making contexts, to analyze their normative and legal bases, their course and their results, to study their multiple effects, to clarify the issues related to their institutionalization as standard of government:</p><p>-a platform for exchange and sharing of research work,</p><p>-doctoral Days,</p><p>-a conference every 2 years largely open on the actors of the participative democracy,</p><p>-scientific workshops,</p><p>-collective tools for exchange (pluridisciplinary dictionary, documentation databases,\u2026)</p><p>By supporting the confrontation of research work drawing on various normative concepts of democracy, led in a critical distance or a proximity with participatory democracy exercises, concerned with the various approaches that cross social sciences, the GIS intends to be a pluralist benchmark instrument for French research on participatory democracy and public participation in decision-making processes. Its activity aims at facilitating the European and international reception of laboratories work, the taking into account of scientific results in the public action, and the diffusion of knowledge towards a large public. <a id=\"Website\" name=\"Website\"></a></p><h2>Website</h2><p>French <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr\">http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr</a> English <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr/node/133\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr/node/133\">http://www.participation-et-democratie.fr/node/133</a></p>", "geo_city": "La Plaine Saint-Denis", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "GIS Participation du Public, D\u00e9cision, D\u00e9mocratie Participative", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/gis-participation-du-public-d-cision-d-mocratie-participative", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": "2", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2011-12-13T23:24:49", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Aur\u00e9lien Sauti\u00e8re", "post_date": "2011-09-02T21:09:38", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "366", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Paris", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": "1", "issue": null, "body_en": "<p>1.

Just contributors. You decide what work you do, when you do it, and how. Contribution determines your ownership, not job titles or office politics. Problems are solved collaboratively. Quickly. Efficiently. And innovation is through the roof.\n</p><p>This kind of business isn\u2019t just an idea. It exists. It\u2019s a system we developed called The Open Enterprise Model. We use it and love it. And now, through the BetterMeans Platform, our aim is to make this model available to everyone who wants it.\n</p><p>As far as we\u2019re concerned, the reinvention of work couldn\u2019t be happening a moment too soon. The old ways of business are breaking down. We\u2019ve worked in top-down, carrot-and-stick corporations. We\u2019ve had our ideas, enthusiasm, and dignity squished against the walls of middle-management and business-as-usual. It sucks. It\u2019s soul-crushing. Not to mention mind-blowingly inefficient.\n</p><p>Fortunately, new ideas are emerging about how organizations can work. A few smart people in a few smart companies have begun doing things differently, and have been rewarded with amazing results. Google, for example, pays employees 1 day a week to work on their own pet projects. Think this yields better innovations? You better believe it.\n</p><p>After studying the problems and the possibilities\u2026 we began to imagine what the ideal workplace might be like. Not just for workers, but for the organization as a whole. (Note: we say \u201cworkers\u201d so you\u2019ll understand\u2026 but the more you read about us, the more you\u2019ll understand why the word doesn\u2019t quite fit anymore.) We tried to imagine what the ideal organizational model looks like.\n</p><p>We thought about what it would take for people to love their jobs. What would happen if they were empowered, inspired, and eager to help their organization succeed. And guess what? If you figure this piece out, you\u2019ve figured out just about everything else you need to know to make an company thrive. It\u2019s simple: fairly distributed ownership.\n</p><p>Okay. It just sounds simple. There\u2019s actually quite a lot involved in making this possible. Suffice it to say that we did it, and we call this organizational structure the Open Enterprise Model. If you want to read more, here are the details of how an Open Enterprise organization works. Check it out. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur or a business owner, it becomes pretty obvious how powerful this model can be for transforming or launching a company.\n</p><p>Once you\u2019ve understood the Open Enterprise Model, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a lot to track. Like the Internet, an Open Enterprise business is interconnected but decentralized. That means anyone can interact with anyone to help move the business towards its goals. There must be tools to allow for this kind of collaboration. Software that can track and manage each person\u2019s contributions, their ideas, voting choices, budget controls, payment systems, and ownership credits among other things.\n</p><p>Because of this, BetterMeans has developed the BetterMeans Platform. This is a comprehensive online platform that handles all of the management details of an Open Enterprise, and gives the organization\u2019s workforce the tools required for \u201cdeep\u201d collaboration.

Notice I used the singular. That's because there is really only one rule that binds Super PACs: that they may not coordinate with candidates' campaigns. But what fun is buying somebody an election if you have no elected official to share the moment with?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>America Crossroads' Karl Rove saw through this sham of a charade \u2013 or \"<em>shamrade</em>\u2122\" \u2013 and petitioned the F.E.C. to clarify exactly what the law is, so he can carefully obey only the letter of it.

Therefore, an evaluation of the group\u2019s success or failure must account for these differences in goals with respect to time.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Certainly, the fact that land seizures and evictions still occur in China<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a> would imply that the videogame platform mentioned earlier has been unsuccessful <em>if</em> the videogame makers\u2019 goal was to cause immediate change in Chinese development policy.\u00a0 However, if the goal of the gamers was to inform, educate, and mobilize a large audience in opposition to Chinese land development policies, then it may have succeeded (at least, in part).\u00a0 The videogame has reached tens of thousands of people and generated widespread discussion on social media platforms.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a></p><br clear=\"all\" /><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> (<em>Cao Ni Ma</em>)\u00a0 A play on the Mandarin words for \u201cfuck your mother.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> Diamond, Larry.\u00a0 <em>Journal of Democracy Volume 21, Number 3. \u201cLiberation Technology.\u201d July 2010.</em></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftn3\">[3]</a> Ye, Juliet and Emma Ashburn. \u201c<em>Fighting Eviction:\u00a0 The Videogame</em>.\u201d <em>The Wall Street Journal. \u00a016 Sept 2010</em></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftn4\">[4]</a> Carr, David. \u201c<em>Comic\u2019s PAC Is More than a Gag.\u201d The New York Times. 22 Aug 2011</em></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftn5\">[5]</a> Jacobs, Andrew. \u201c<em>Harassment and Evictions Bedevil Even China\u2019s Well-Off.\u201d \u00a0The New York Times</em>. 27 Oct 2011</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftn6\">[6]</a> Ye, Juliet and Emma Ashburn. \u201c<em>Fighting Eviction:\u00a0 The Videogame</em>.\u201d <em>The Wall Street Journal. \u00a016 Sept 2010</em></p><h3>Conclusions and Implications</h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Perhaps Colbert\u2019s intention was to prove a point about money in politics and inform the public of a real threat to democracy, but he may have inadvertently helped to catalyze the next generation of protesters in America.\u00a0 It is not a coincidence that the same issues raised by the Colbert Super PAC are echoed by the OCCUPY movements which have sprouted in several US cities in recent months.\u00a0 In fact, Sophia A. McClennen, a Professor at Penn State University, recently wrote an op-ed piece titled \u201cHas the Colbert Nation Occupied Wall Street?\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the article, McClennen writes, \u201cacross the globe and from US city to US city, we watch daily as waves of protesters, many of them young, take to the streets. Such images seemed impossible five years ago. Back then the mainstream buzz was that the youth were \u201cstoned slackers\u201d \u2014 too narcissistic and tech obsessed to engage in real protest. Where did all of this young activist energy come from?\u00a0 The Colbert Nation \u2026 In the space created by his ironic satire he encourages his audience to question the media, politicians, and the power structure in ways that are not totally dissimilar to OWS \u2026 missing that connection, though, means missing the art of satire since satirical humor mocks those who make a folly of politics and it exposes social absurdities that the public has come to take for granted. Such a form of mockery is the first step in showing the public that they can challenge the status quo \u2026 But aren\u2019t Colbert\u2019s fans just fans? Don\u2019t they just follow him?

Public consultation is required broadly as part of the democratic process. Governments at all levels directly or indirectly require consultation on a range of issues, most of which are geographically defined. PlaceSpeak taps into that need to consult and adds value by generating verifiable data to support public policy development and local decision-making. PlaceSpeak takes the guesswork out of online consultation.\u00a0<h3>Business Model</h3>PlaceSpeak\u2019s mission is to empower people everywhere to provide their verifiable feedback on public consultations, and we believe the best way to achieve that mission is by combining the values of a non-profit with the flexibility and innovation of a tech startup. We're a new kind of company: a \"social enterprise,\" using the power of business for social good. Like most companies, PlaceSpeak has a business model that allows us to grow rapidly and be financially self-sustaining, providing thousands of people with a free public consultation platform. But unlike many companies, our business is social good.<p>We fund our free public participation platform by charging proponents of consultations a license fee. We do not sell advertising (like Facebook and Google) and we do not sell our participants\u2019 personal information (like market research firms). We recognize that privacy is mission critical. We charge community groups and non-profit organization 1/10th of the cost of the Standard subscription. We do charge because human behaviour dictates that people take things more seriously when they pay for them than when they do not. Of course, citizen participants engage for free!</p><p>Specialization</p><ul><li>Online public consultations</li></ul><h3>Hightlighted Projects</h3><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.placespeak.com/topic/1360-surrey-school-district-a-vision-for-the-future/#!/overview\">Surrey School District - A Vision for the Future</a></strong> (2014-15)\u00a0to gather information from parents, staff and the broader community on the programs and opportunities that the Surrey School Board should children in the future?</li><li><strong>Calgary Future Skatepark Amenities</strong> (2014) to involve residents in the selection process for future skatepark facilities within the City of Calragy</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.placespeak.com/topic.php?id=323\">Metro Vancouver Urban Futures Survey</a></strong>\u00a0(2012) to determine long term trends in the relative importance of a number of community and regional issues.</li></ul><h3>External Links</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://placespeak.com\">PlaceSpeak.com</a></li><li><a href=\"http://blog.placespeak.com\">PlaceSpeak blog</a></li></ul>", "geo_city": "Vancouver", "tags": "public participation||public engagement", "geo_province": "British Columbia", "title_en": "PlaceSpeak", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/placespeak", "geo_phone": "+1.778.999.7677", "geo_latitude": "49\u00b0 16' 36.3756\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1126", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "123\u00b0 8' 51.5796\" W", "fulltime_staff": "9", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"PlaceSpeakTM.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2012-01-13T16:13:01", "volunteer_count": "10", "geo_street": "1783 Campus Delivery<br />Eddy Building 210", "executive_director": "Martin Carcasson", "post_date": "2012-01-13T16:08:16", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "80523-1783", "id": "488", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Colorado State University", "geo_country": "United States", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": "3 plus 30 students", "issue": null, "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0The CPD is dedicated to enhancing local democracy through improved public communication and community problem solving.

It operates primary during the fall and spring semesters, working around 5 major projects a semester.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>The CPD provides expertise on deliberative democracy and collaborative problem solving. The CPD works with local government and community organizations to assist with a broad range of projects. CPD students are trained as facilitators and process experts, and work on all aspects of process design, including preliminary research and analysis, convening, process design, meeting facilitation, notetaking, and reporting. CPD has expertise and experience on a wide variety of deliberative techniques such as National Issues Forums, study circles, cafe style, large group methods, wireless keypads, creative problem-solving, etc.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0The CPD works on several projects every semester. Past projects have focused on poverty, K-12 and higher education, homelessness,\u00a0childhood obesity, and arts, among others (annual reports are available on the CPD website at cpd.colostate.edu). Current projects as off January 2012 include food politics, student housing, water conflict, regional growth, and aging.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0The CPD is funded in part by the College of Liberal Arts at Colorado State University, particularly by allocating parts of Mart\u00edn Carcasson and Leah Sprain's time as faculty to the work of the center. The CPD has also received several grants from the Bohemian Foundation, and Dr. Carcasson has received several learning contracts from the Kettering Foundation to support his research.</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>Mart\u00edn Carcasson, \u201cFacilitating Democracy through Passionate Impartiality: Communication Studies Programs and Students Should Serve as Local Resources,\u201d <em>Spectra 47, 3 </em>(2011), 3-7.

The Center, which is housed within Merrimack College\u2019s School of Education, brings together faculty, administrators, and community partners to support such academic programs through a variety of initiatives and practices: compiling existing research and documentation to support new and developing programs; sponsoring symposia, conferences, and research opportunities to build a vibrant research base and academic community; and providing a voice and space for dialogue for the value of such academic programs across higher education.</p><h3>History</h3><p>In 2010 the Center was founded by Dan Butin. For over the past five years his reasearch has focused on the argument for the institutionalization of community engagement in higher education. His interest in institutionalizing community engagement led to the development of this central research and action hub to develop, coordinate, and support academic programs that are focused on community engagement.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p><strong>Compilation</strong></p><p>Currently the Center is compiling existing research and documentation to support new and developing programs.

(AGORAS), an international nonprofit 501(c)(3) [EIN 03-0466448] education entity incorporated in the State of California in June 2002, is a membership organization composed of university-affiliated, independent, and corporate social system design managers who promote and enable the practice of authentic, large group, collaborative design.\u00a0 The AGORAS operates as a \u201cvirtual organization\u201d conducting most of its business through conferences and convened regional and international meetings.\u00a0 Corporate Headquarters are located at the Executive Director\u2019s preferred mailing address, which at this time is 8213 Hwy 85 #901, Riverdale, Georgia 30274 USA.\u00a0 The corporate website is <a href=\"http://www.globalagoras.org.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\">www.globalagoras.org.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</a></p><p>By corporate charter, the AGORAS will:</p><ul><li>Promote the idea of human connectedness and interdependence (the \u201cglobal village\u201d)</li><li>Promote democratic processes for addressing the problems and opportunities associated with global economic and political integration (\u201cglobalization\u201d)</li><li>Promote the establishment of co-laboratories of democracy (also known as 21st Century Agoras)</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The AGORAS pioneers the adaptation of tools forged from systems science and civic engagement to enable groups to take on \"wicked problems\" of the 21st century and discover both the depth of their situation and the preferred path for their collective futures</p><p>The AGORAS is a reincarnation of a lost tribe of the original Club of Rome.\u00a0 Some histories report that the Club of Rome was founded in April 1968 by Aurelio Peccei, an Italian scholar, industrialist and author of The Chasm Ahead, and Alexander King, a Scottish scientist., and operated with an informal \"inner group\" that included four others: Hugo Thiemann (Director of the Battelle Institute in Geneva), Max Kohnstamm Former Secretary General of the ECSC), Jean Saint-Geours (Ministry of Finance in Paris) and Erich Jantsch, author of \"Technological Forecasting.\u201d\u00a0 Aurelio Peccei brought Hasan \u00d6zbekhan and Alexander Christakis into the circle in 1970.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter, Alexander Christakis and Hasan \u00d6zbekhan discontinued their affiliation due to profound philosophical disagreements about the hierarchical nature of the global planning process which the Club of Rome chose to adopt.\u00a0 Forty years later, Alexander Christakis has returned to launch the AGORAS equipped with tools that enable the bottoms up planning capacities so critically missing from the Club of Rome</p><p>[for an update on the Club of Rome see: <a href=\"http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/about/4/\"><u>http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/about/4/</u></a>].</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><p><em><u>To Promote the Idea of Human Connectedness and Interdependence</u></em></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS has an email practitioner and interested party base of 2000 professionals distributed world wide as of December 2008.\u00a0 The AGORAS communicates to this practitioner base through an electronic newsletter called \u201c<em>The Agora eBuzz</em>\u201d and through a corporate website.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS provides informational seminars, published reports, and training opportunities on structured dialogic design, and provides resource identification assistance for individuals or organizations who are looking for certified SDD practitioners in their geographic region or in their specific field of application. \u00a0This social networking includes linking practitioners on the basis of SDD project histories.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS identifies and engages sources of philanthropic and competitive grant support to convene practitioners into campaigns for social transformation through authentic democratic processes.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em><u>To Promote Democratic Process</u></em></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS maintains an archive of field applications of SDD under the oversight of a corporate research director.\u00a0 Archives will be accepted from any and all individuals who use structured dialogic design for democratic social system services, and collaborative research proposals will be seriously considered from all professional organizations addressing complex challenges which can advance resolution of global economic and political isolation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS maintains an active presence at societies and associations that promote applied democracy through citizen engagement and participation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS will seek to host one international summit or retreat for the global practice of structured dialogic design on a five year cycle, and will derive from these summits a consensus view of the barriers, opportunities, or essential action options required to advance the global democracy.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em><u>To Promote the Establishment of Co-laboratories</u></em></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS maintains and distributes free Microsoft DOS software (with a users guide) to introduce emerging practitioners to tools for constructing influence maps under the structured dialogic design protocol.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS holds the service mark (trademark) from the US Patent and Trademark Office for the commercial use of \u201cstructured dialogic design\u201d (SDD) in the field of social system design, and the AGORAS certifies participation in official SDD informational events as well as achievement of levels of proficiency of practice through its certified SDD training and apprenticeship programs.\u00a0 SDD training is currently provided by individually recognized SDD experts in classrooms and communities in Cyprus, Mexico, the United States of America, The United Kingdom, India, Japan and Australia.\u00a0 In all locations, SDD differentiates itself as a technical collaborative design practice distinct from traditional facilitation service.\u00a0 Making this distinction, however, can put SDD into a position which may seem to compete with local group facilitation practices.\u00a0\u00a0 The AGORAS seeks to support local group facilitation practices when these practices find themselves dealing with a social system problem that is genuinely a wicked problem (e.g., the important elements of the problem are misunderstood or poorly understood, rapidly evolving, and interacting with each other in unpredictable ways).\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>The AGORAS typically works in groups that are recruited to inclusively convene distinct perspectives from across communities of practice and communities of place.\u00a0 These events range in size from 30 to several hundered participants.\u00a0 The full scope of engagement in the 40 year history of this practice fills several recent books.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The AGORAS coordinates practitioner teams for groundbreaking applications of structured dialogic design.\u00a0 Some of these innovative applications include:</p><p>1.\u00a0 Curriculum design and education system reorganization</p><p>2.\u00a0 Online decision making platforms</p><p>3.\u00a0 Healthcare system evolution</p><p>4.\u00a0 Municipal decision making process enhancement</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>AGORAS co-laboratories of democracy are funded by philanthropic sponsors at the community, state, national and intenational level.\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><h2>Co-Laboratories of Democracy:\u00a0 How People Harness Their Collective Wisdon to Create the Future</h2><h2>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By: <a class=\"bookLink\"

Through public assembly, the participants challenge the roles of government, corporations, and big banks throughout the greater Seattle area.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Definition</h3><p>Occupy Seattle is an \u201cextended public occupation\" in Seattle, representative of a <a href=\"http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Direct_democracy\">\u201cDirect Democracy,\u201d</a> in which in a public assembly forum any and all can equally participate in the \"deliberative democracy\" process. Linda Maduz, at the Center for International and Comparative Studies,\u00a0at the University of Zurich, argues that,\u00a0\"direct democracy is a term denoting a variety of processes and institutions, guaranteeing people\u2019s (direct) involvement in political decision-making\" [1].\u00a0</p><p>Seattle's \"Occupy\" movement\u00a0was begun by a diverse group of Seattleites who joined the nationwide Occupy movement.\u00a0It started with the Occupy Wall Street resistance movement in New York City's Zuccotti Park. The movement began on September 17, 2011,\u00a0\u00a0protesting\u00a0the social and economic inequality of the majority\u00a0[2]. The movement\u00a0wants to focus elected officials, and the voting public on the majorities desire to \u201ctake our government and country back from the big-money interests that currently hold undue sway over the decisions that affect us all.\u201d The participants are coming together in large numbers to effect this change. Their activity centers within the Seattle area, and although they have the same consensus as the national movement, their efforts are limited to regional activities [3].</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Occupy Seattle argues that the problems that many of us are confronted with, are a result of the unfair distribution of wealth in America, leading to economic and social inequality among the people. The participants are challenging the roles of government, corporations, and big banks all across America, particularly in Seattle. The purpose of the Occupy Movement is to create a forum of public assembly in which the participants can have a voice through a \u201cDirect Democracy,\u201d utilizing the deliberative process to express their discontent and hope for change.</p><p>G. William Domhoff, Professor of Sociology at the University of California, presented a series of graphs in his article \"Wealth, Income, and Power\" that explains the \"wealth\" breakdown in America. Domhoff's research pointed out that \u00a0the 1% only had 42.7% of the wealth, and 19% had 50.3%, leaving the remaining 80% with 7% of the wealth. When considering the research presented by Domhoff, it is clear that there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. In support of the \u201cOccupy\u201d movement, Domhoff explains, \"that it will be a surprise and then some, because of a recent study (Norton &amp; Ariely, 2010) showing that most Americans (high income or low income, female or male, young or old, Republican or Democrat) have no idea just how concentrated the wealth distribution actually is\" [4].</p><p>One clear purpose of the Occupy Seattle movement, and their direct democracy public assemblies, is to make the citizens of the greater Seattle area aware of this growing gap between the rich and the poor. As stated by G. William Domhoff, most Americans are unaware of these facts, much less have any control over them. The \"Occupy\" movement in Seattle, and all across America, are addressing this problem with a purpose of doing something about it through the deliberative process of public assembly. These wishes of the people were clearly demonstrated during one of Seattle's very first \"get acquainted\" assemblies, when one of the participants shouted out, \"We want our country back\" [5]!</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>Occupy Seattle began with a demonstration at the Federal Building in downtown Seattle on September 26, 2011. The movement is a direct action demonstration activity, that was, and still is, inspired by the \u201cOccupy America\u201d movement. It first began in New York City when an\u00a0organization known as \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d held\u00a0their first\u00a0public assembly,\u00a0protesting against the financial greed and corruption in the Wall Street district of New York City.\u00a0Not too long after that fateful moment, the occupy movement\u00a0spread all across America. By October 9, 2011, similar demonstrations were either ongoing or had been held in 70 major cities and over 600 communities across the U.S.\u00a0[6]. The participants of this newly formed direct democracy are citizens\u00a0from all across the U.S. who are opposed to the inequality of wealth, corporate greed, and the corruption\u00a0of the banking and economic systems in America. They are calling on all Americans to speak out against the 1% who have all the wealth, and the 99% who are disenfranchised and charged with paying back the economic wrongs that the 1% created. Proponents of the Occupy movement cite the \u201cbig money interests\u201d as those who are responsible [7]. Since\u00a0its creation, as the numbers demonstrate, support for\u00a0the \"Occupy\" movement has grown, raising the awareness of corporate greed\u00a0throughout the Puget Sound region [8].</p><p>Occupy Seattle's \"deliberative democracy\" has already begun challenging the Presidential election arena, as with the more recent demonstrations that were held during Rick Santorum's recent visit to Tacoma Washington. After he was faced with a handful of angry protestors who shouted through his entire event, he claimed that the \u201cOccupy\u201d movement was an example of \u201ctrue intolerance.\u201d This was in response to the tensions that flared when Santorum cited a recent decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that California's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Later during an interview with Rebecca Kaplan, of CBS News, Santorum stated that what the protesters said, was, \u201cthat anybody who disagreed with them were irrational and the only reason they could possibly agree is they were a hater or a bigot,\" inflaming the crowd even more, which in turn led to several arrests [9].</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participation Selection</h3><p>The \"Participation Selection\" process of the Occupy Seattle organization is unique in the sense that the participant selects the \"Working Group\" that they find most interesting to them. Whether their interest is General Topics, Operations, Communication, Arts and Entertainment, or simply participating in the General Assembly,\u00a0all they need to do is contact that group using the contact information provided on the Occupy Seattle website.</p><p>Joining Occupy Seattle\u00a0means \"getting together and discussing lots of issues.\" From General Assemblies, to Daytime Discussions, Occupy Seattle has events planned for most days of the week. Participants are asked to follow the rules of \"Accountability Principles and Process.\" This informs the participant on\u00a0how to handle conflict, harm, and violations of community agreements within their communities during a public assembly. It also informs the participant how to \u00a0work together and listen over opposition and banishment, by having respect for the humanity of all individuals involved. Finally, to participate with transparency and responsibility within the community, paying close attention to the power dynamics of privilege and oppression [10].</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interactions</h3><p>In the Occupy Seattle public assembly forum, decisions are made through\u00a0an open deliberative process of a \u201cDirect Democracy\u201d in the form of a public assembly. The members of the Occupy Seattle movement are made up of ordinary citizens of the city of Seattle and the surrounding regions.</p><p>On October 1, 2011, Occupy Seattle's very first official public assembly, the members clearly voiced their frustrations about\u00a0the roles of government, corporations, and big banks all across American in an equal deliberative forum, in which they shared their own personal ideas and experiences with each other. Their cries for key values, and possible solutions took on an array of different views. In one such view, one woman spoke out contesting her discontent by crying out, \"Voting clearly didn't work, so were taking to the streets and making it clear that people are upset.\" Another participant stated, \"This is not right or left, this is right or wrong.\" This example of an equal opportunity to voice their views, was clearly expressed when a megaphone was passed around to the various participants, giving each of them a chance to voice their opinions, and beliefs. One such participant in frustration went on to say, \"I'm ready for real democracy!\" Another cried out, \"I'm tired of the 1% telling us that were supposed to pay for this crisis, the one that they caused, we are the 99% and we want our country back.\" This is the unique way in which the Occupy Seattle movement has fostered equal deliberation [11]!</p><p>Occupy Seattle identifies their strength as a deliberative movement that is both \u201cleaderless and leaderful\u201d. A new agreement\u00a0was recently passed in\u00a0Occupy Seattle's\u00a0General Assembly on November 16, 2011, stating their policy on unity, solidarity, and debate. First and foremost, the occupy members have agreed that no irrational attacks can be made by any members of the General Assembly. \u00a0Additionally, they focus actions around their main goal of defending each other and defending the movement within the realms of a healthy debate. Second, no negative actions are to be taken towards occupiers with opposing views that could damage their well being. However,\u00a0a caveat to this rule may be applied if the occupier has external goals that go against the general unity and aspirations of the movement. Thirdly, no members are allowed to demonstrate any action that appears to be \u201cfascist, racist, sexist, homophobic, white-nationalist populist, ageist, etc.\u201d Finally, if a conclusion or new guidelines are decided upon, the General Assembly is the only governing body of the movement allowed to declare this action as an official Occupy Seattle decision. The General Assembly recognizes that individual occupiers may take their own stance, and although their actions will be supported, the occupiers must understand that the General Assembly holds the power to pass all official Occupy Seattle actions [12].</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcome, and Effects </h3><p>As recent as November 14th, 2011, The City of Seattle recognized the need of the Occupy Seattle members to peacefully practice their First Amendment rights. Council member Nick Licata supported the passing of Resolution 31337, a resolution recognizing and supporting, \"the peaceful and lawful exercise of the First Amendment as a cherished and fundamental right, in an effort to seek solutions for economically distressed Americans at federal and local levels.\" The passage of this resolution fully supports the right of the Occupy Seattle members to peacefully protest the widening income gap that is affecting millions of Americans, by having their voices heard, with the hopes of eliminating unjust financial practices\u00a0[13].</p><p>The goal in passing this resolution was to bring attention to the economic\u00a0concerns of the 99%, in hopes that Congress will recognize it as an important agenda issue, as well as the need to reach a consensus on a solution. Resolution 31337 has also allowed the City of Seattle to foster ideas and solutions by investigating the structural causes currently in place. Continual further actions by the Seattle City Council, includes looking at the City\u2019s current banking practices, their patterns in home foreclosures, as well as current initiatives that foster inequalities [14].</p><p>Occupy Seattle has had a significant influence on those challenged during public assemblies. One such example was a\u00a0year ago, when the leaders of the University of Washington's Foster School of Business booked JP Morgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon as the keynote speaker\u00a0for their business leadership dinner. Protesters marched through the downtown of Seattle to the hotel where Dimon was speaking. JP Morgan Chase has been\u00a0a recent\u00a0target of the protestors,\u00a0because of its acquisition of the former Washington Mutual Corporation, a buyout that put 3,400 Washington \u00a0Mutual employees out of work, and left much of the former bank's downtown real estate empty. The protestors locked arms, and attempted to barricade the hotel entrances, while chanting and waving signs, stating, \"Prosecute the Real Thieves,\u201d and \"What are profits if you lose your soul?\" Hoping\u00a0to have some effect on the general public, through this peaceful, and legal public assembly.\u00a0The Seattle Times and other local reporters talked to the JP Morgan Chase CEO before his speech that night, and he said he understood the protesters' frustration with Wall Street claiming, \"They're right, in general, these big institutions of America let them down,\u201d\u00a0acknowledging the \"occupiers\"\u00a0discontent.\u00a0</p><p>In another part of town earlier that day, activists surrounded a Chase bank, prompting clashes between protesters and police. Leading to the arrests\u00a0of five people suspected of trespassing. Police said in their report that at least 10 officers were physically assaulted while removing activists from the scene of the bank protest, with two suffering minor injuries. Additionally, pepper spray was deployed to push back the protesters at the bank.</p><p>Occupy's statement on that fateful day was, \"We are hoping, that by our presence at the event where he is a keynote speaker, we will let him and the larger community know that the public is no longer tolerating the misdeeds of the big banks\" [15].</p><p>So what has Occupy Seattle accomplished? The strong proponents, as well as the participants themselves, say they have \"heightened awareness, struck a nerve with the American public,\" and that they are educating the people [16]. Just as with the passing of a resolution, giving the \"Occupiers\" the right to peacefully protest, or a large corporation's CEO\u00a0candidly acknowledging the \"occupiers\" discontent over an issue, progress by the Occupy Seattle organization is subtle, but it is making a difference to the people of Seattle. Their voices are being heard.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Proponents of the \u201cOccupy\u201d movement argue that although the public assembly process, in a direct democracy forum, is healthy and rigorous, they also\u00a0claim that little is accomplished at just one\u00a0public assembly. They recognize that it can provide citizens a chance at voicing their opinions, frustrations, and possible solutions, however, they argue that one voice is not enough. Wezel McClellan, from Asheville, N.C., an active \"Occupier,\" offers younger\u00a0participants advice based on his own experience\u00a0during the civil rights movement. He tells them not to get discouraged, \"When you look back at what's really worked in history, none of it happened because one rally changed everything. You just have to keep fighting and speak up until you're heard\" [17].</p><p>Occupy Seattle is part of a growing movement all across America. It is a chance for those who would not ordinarily\u00a0get involved, to play a part in a \"Deliberative Democracy,\" by interacting with fellow citizens who share the same beliefs,\u00a0who also\u00a0wish to voice their views.\u00a0An unknown news reporter from Reuters News agency said it best, by saying, \"I just like what they stand for, they stand for equality [18].\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>1. <a href=\"http://democracy.livingreviews.org/index.php/lrd/article/viewFile/lrd-2010-1/21\">Maduz, Linda. \u201cDirect Democracy.\u201d Living Reviews in Democracy.</a> Center For International and Comparative Studies.

DARP\u2019s mission is to bring a more empirical and collaborative approach to the study of digital citizen engagement, in context of the important role global digital activism has played in the evolution of non-violent conflicts, democratization, and peace-building efforts around the world.</p><p>DARP aims to elevate research about digital media and its effects on international relations by compiling an online database of cases of digital activism. DARP has built an information database and created a way for the public to better study, access, and understand digital activism. By linking scholars and activists to resources like the<a href=\"http://www.meta-activism.org/infobox/data-set/\"> Global Digital Activism Data Set</a> (explained below), DARP is unique in its effort to create \u201ca deliberate dissemination strategy to reach out to policy makers.\u201d</p><p>The Digital Activism Research Project is centered on the Global Digital Activism Data Set (GDADS). This data set logs and codes over 1,200 digital activism cases from a set of some 140 countries around the world. Through GDADS, scholars can determine which types of activism have been effective in various countries, communities, and environments around the world. They can then use the knowledge and information gained from the data set to better develop cases of their own using a standardized format.</p><p>Supplementary information on digital activism is also available through the DARP website. Articles, books, and films about digital activism can be accessed through links free of charge, so that the larger public and scholars can learn more. DARP is a project of the University of Washington Department of Communication and is funded by the United States Institute of Peace and the MacArthur Foundation.</p><p>The project relies on open collaboration, and participants come from diverse backgrounds and areas of knowledge. The researchers and advisors who maintain DARP have aggregated several open access data sets on digital activism and seek to make that information and methodology for studying digital activism widely available.</p><h6><strong>Problems and Purpose</strong></h6><p>The purpose of the Digital Activism Project is to promote more effective and empirical study of activism through digital forums. Co-founder and Project Manager of DARP,<a href=\"http://zapboom.com/\"> Mary Joyce</a>, defined the purpose of digital activism as \u201cthe use of digital technology in grassroots efforts to achieve social and political change\u201d (Mari).</p><p>The primary problem that DARP hopes to address is the lack of coherent resources and methodology available to digital activists and researchers. DARP organizers intend to engage students, work with other research institutions, and take advantage of DARP\u2019s digital platform to improve and expand upon the existing field of study. In this way, DARP seeks to improve the foreign policy expertise of scholars, activists, and policy-makers so they are better able to understand international relations in a digital era. DARP serves as a unifier of online and offline politics, and works to connect with policy-makers more deliberately by providing them access to DARP\u2019s digital tools and database.</p><h6><strong>History</strong></h6><p>The Digital Research Project was founded by Mary Joyce and Philip Howard and launched in October 2012. Co-founder, and current Project Manager, Mary Joyce, previously founded the Meta-Activism Project in 2010, the precursor to DARP, as well as another grassroots activism website called DigiActive.org in 2007. As an experienced digital activist, Joyce also served as New Media Operations Manager on Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign for president.</p><p>Joyce first created the Global Digital Activism Data Set (GDADS) in 2010. Originally, GDADS was intended to bring a \u201cbody of strategic knowledge unique to the field of digital activism\u201d to the masses through a digital format. With the creation of DARP, the data set\u2019s goal has expanded to also providing experts and scholars with necessary and effective tools to analyze digital activism.</p><h6><strong>Participant Selection</strong></h6><p>The Digital Activism Research Project website allows anyone willing to contribute their knowledge of digital activism to participate. Additionally, the site welcomes contributors who collect cases pertaining to digital activism and those who wish to develop applications for the site. Although the site thrives on the submission of materials from scholars and academics that share a passion for digital activism, everyday operations, upkeep, and data compilation are conducted by the site\u2019s Researchers and Advisors.</p><p>The website operates under a Creative Commons Attribution license in order to promote networking. This license allows the data and knowledge that DARP produces to be shared in the most transparent way.</p><h6><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></h6><p>The Digital Activism Research Project makes it easy to explore information about digital activism and its effects. DARP facilitates deliberation through uses of digital technology, such as social networking (e.g Facebook and Twitter), blogs, websites, data sets, and other electronic text.</p><p>The Global Digital Activism Data Set allows volunteers to participate and contribute to current cases involving digital activism all over the globe. The contributions are compiled into an open resource that scholars can use to research and analyze the effects of digital activism. Researches can use GDADS to see what cases of digital activism were successful in the past, allowing them to understand policy implications. The website offers free download of the code book, case study list, and data sets. Additionally, DARP contains links to presentations, methodologies, and visual representations of digital activism data.</p><p>DARP is committed to providing research that follows a consistent set of standards and definitions. The \u201cCoder Tools\u201d section of the site contains a Codebook of submission guidelines, designed \u201cto create a set of common definitions for the variables which we are using to analyze the case studies in the data set.\u201d Following these guidelines and using the Code Submission Form, researchers can submit a Digital Activism Case, in which digital technology was used in a campaign of social/political change initiated by citizens or used to alter public discussion. Cases should include information about framing effects and mobilizing structures, and should reference trustworthy sources. The Codebook contains six sections to be completed for each Digital Activism Case: (1) Case Meta-Data (2) Time Data (3) Actor Data (4) Geographic Data (5) Application Data (6) Strategy Data. Each section contains a number of variables to be identified for each individual case. Every input for a variable is identified by a different \u201ccode,\u201d as defined by the DARP Codebook, and once a case is complete, the data can be quantified according to the codes that have been entered.</p><p>Before submitting Digital Activism Cases, coders must view the Coder Training presentation posted to the site. Upon completion, researchers can then contact DARP researchers to be assigned cases to enter into the database.</p><p>Additionally, DARP publishes news about the project, resources, and events about digital activism on the website blog. DARP also use Twitter (@ActivelyDigital) to introduce the project and spread information about digital activism by sending out links to articles pertaining to DARP\u2019s projects, blog posts, project updates, and by engaging in discussion about digital media. On their website, DARP also provides links to other projects, blogs, or websites that seek to promote, study, or provide information about digital activism. DARP also provides an extensive bibliography of books, articles, newspapers, blogs, and films pertaining to digital activism and global communications. DARP offers these resources to make comprehensive knowledge on digital activism and its effects available to those interested in the subject. This engages more people in digital activism research and helps DARP attain its goal of creating a collaborative and engaged group of scholars, researchers, and citizens studying digital activism.</p><h6><strong>Influence, Outcome, and Effects</strong></h6><p>The Digital Activism Research Project is influencing people throughout the world by creating a comprehensive database, methodology, and collaborative space for people to study digital activism and its effects. DARP allows people to see how digital activism is being used around the world and helps them to analyze the implications and institutional effects on activism on conflict and long-term peace-building efforts. Digital activism is constantly changing and growing, thus by providing a place for collaboration and systemic, empirical research, DARP helps policy makers better understand the effects of digital activism, especially in terms of foreign policy creation. DARP is unique in its collaborative approach. All of the information available on the website is available to anyone, anywhere, and the data sets generated by DARP administrators are a valuable, informative, and educational tool for researchers and policy makers, alike.</p><h6><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></h6><p>There are some areas of DARP that need work. In order for the project to keep up with ever-expanding and growing field of digital activism, the project requires more volunteers and coders. The project requires constant oversight, content production, and analysis by researchers to compile cases into a single, comprehensible data set. The major challenge faced by DARP is putting its database and digital tools into the hands of policymakers. Material needs to be easily accessible and easily utilized by researchers and policymakers.</p><p>Outreach is an essential and difficult component of the project, and one of DARP\u2019s potential areas of improvement is the expansion of its language format. DARP is committed to serving as a global digital activism database, and yet many of the cases that are submitted cannot be added because the volunteers are only English speakers. Furthermore, DARP faces potential problems because it is an online-only resource. If the website crashes, is hacked, or otherwise fails to operate, participants and users have no other way of accessing the material.</p><p>DARP provides a powerful resource to researchers, policymakers, and the interesting public. By creating a consistent and empirical methodology for analyzing digital activism, DARP offers invaluable access to data and broader implications for future study. DARP provides insight into what technologies work best in certain countries, the ages of people most affected by digital activism, or how technology can help traditional activism to spread the word on a larger scale, among other areas of interest. The potential influence of this project is vast, with academic and practical implications.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Secondary Sources</strong></p><p>\"About.\" <em>digital-activism.org.</em> The Digital Activism Research Project, 2013.

Their overall aim is not to play a role in parliament as any other political party. They want to have their name present on the ballot as a means to generate interest in the ideology of direct democracy. Their current goal is to reach 550 members to be eligible to be placed on the Australian electoral ballot. They currently have a total of 121 members to date. At this time, according to their annual meeting minutes, finding ways of gathering new members to join their cause is their primary concern.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Problems and Purpose</strong></p><p>Just as their slogan states on their website: \u201cPoliticians always make the decisions but who knows what we need better than we do?\u201d (rulebythepeople.org). The ultimate purpose is written in their organization\u2019s \u2018constitution\u2019 which promotes direct democracy as an alternative to parliamentary rule. As the director of this organization states in their first ever newsletter, \u201cthe greatest challenge we face is exposing the farcical nature of parliamentary rule\u201d (News 1). Proving to the rest of the public that a Parliamentary Rule is not going to bring about the kind of changes they seek is their greatest problem. Convincing the voters that the current legislative system is flawed and a need for direct democracy is beneificial for everyone is the biggest problem they will face. The organization hopes to put candidates in Federal elections both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. They \u201caim to create a society based on direct democratic principles where the people involved in a decision make that decision and appoint delegates to coordinate those decisions at local, regional and national levels\u201d (rulebythepeople.org/constitution). The another issue they are facing is finding new members. Since the start of this organization almost a decade ago the number of stable members continues to fluxuate.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>\u2018Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule\u2019 first assembled on December 3rd 2003 at Ballarat on the 150th anniversary of the Eureka rebellion. This event emphasizes the impact that direct democracies can have in societies (News 1). This group believes direct democracy is the best and true system towards a more healthy and meaningful Australia because the people will have a direct say in where their resources are allocated (rulebythepeople/about).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Participant Selection</strong></p><p>The current members of \u2018Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule\u2019 reside in Australia who support the cause and ideals of direct democracy over a Parliamentary system. The application to become a member of this organization only require that the prospective member be eligible to enroll for federal elections. Meaning the prospect must be 17 years of age or older, must be an Australian citizen, and must have lived at the present address for at least the last month. Since theis group is aiming at collecting 550 members to be mentioned on the ballot, all are encouraged to participate.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong><strong> / Specializations and activities</strong></p><p>\u2018Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule\u2019 holds annual general meetings at the mentioned rented space [supplied at the sidebar]. These annual general meetings [AGM] are performed in a formal manner; the National Convenor opens the meeting, the secretary keeps track of the minutes and later posts the minutes of the meeting on their organization website. There are two other meetings held in addition to the AGM, these meetings are held every four months where they discuss nominations for Nation Convenor, Registered Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary. \u00a0The nominee must provide nominee details, acceptance of nomination, and signatures from three other members of the organization. Nominations are then added into the following newsletter. The meetings consists of decisions about a need for more members. They best way to achieve that goal is if each existing member sign up one new member within the following year. The meeting also establishes the location, time, and date of the next meeting. Then they briefly conclude with a summary of the meeting, and address the need for financial support. All meetings are open to the public (AGM-Minutes).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Influence, Outcome, and Effects</strong><strong>/ major projects and events</strong></p><p>Since this group consists of 121 members and has not had the chance to be a part of the official ballot they are still on the path of reaching their goals to change the electoral system entirely. As an organization they have attempted spreading their message by means other than the internet and newsletters. They attend events such as public discussions at the local community center and referendum conferences to help share their cause.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Funding</strong></p><p>This organization requires each member to supply two $.55 stamps annually to help pay for the cost of sending out newsletters for five years membership. Also written in their constitution those who are chosen to represent this group must make decisions that reflect the majority opinion. They pledge under oath that if they do not fulfill their direct democracy duties as representatives in parliamentary they will give up their seat and give back any wages they received as Senator or Representative.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></p><p>This was an overview of a still rather unknown direct democracy organization in Australia, the purpose for this criticism is to help spread the word about this growing organization. This was an introduction to a group I stumbled upon and found interesting. I support their efforts indubitably. The concept of a direct democracy is completely logical but in terms of making this organization more noticeable is the only critique I have to offer. For a political party that has existed for nine years, 121 members is reasonable. If this group were to publish their ideas and more indepth goals and plans on the web it would make for a more legitamate proposal. This group to should attend this open conferences and discussions and document them and put them online for the world to see.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Secondary Sources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/constitution.php\">http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/constitution.php</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?news=0\">http://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?news=0</a></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>External Links</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?a=aboutus\">http://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?a=aboutus</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.politicsandculture.org/2010/08/10/the-eureka-rebellion-of-1854-by-eric-petersen-2/\">http://www.politicsandculture.org/2010/08/10/the-eureka-rebellion-of-1854-by-eric-petersen-2/</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/DDNPR%20ARTICLE%20-%20PARLIAMENTARY%20ALTERNATIVES.pdf\">http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/DDNPR%20ARTICLE%20-%20PARLIAMENTARY...</a></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Notes.</strong></p><p>News 1 - <a href=\"http://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?news=1\">http://www.rulebythepeople.org/index.php?news=1</a></p><p>AGM- Minutes - <a href=\"http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/AGM-Minutes-2009.pdf\">http://www.rulebythepeople.org/media/AGM-Minutes-2009.pdf</a></p><br clear=\"ALL\" />\u00a0<br clear=\"ALL\" /><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "Fitzroy", "tags": "Australia DirectDemocracy", "geo_province": "Victoria", "title_en": "Direct Democracy Not Parliamentary Rule", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/direct-democracy-not-parliamentary-rule", "geo_phone": "0439 395 489", "geo_latitude": "37\u00b0 48' 28.7532\" S", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1232", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "144\u00b0 58' 57.3708\" E", "fulltime_staff": "121", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2012-03-01T19:07:46", "volunteer_count": "???", "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2012-02-29T22:00:35", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "536", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Internet", "geo_country": "", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Human Rights||Other", "body_en": "<p><strong>Anonymous</strong> is a decentralized <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hacktivist\">hacktivist</a> collective. A variety of internet sub-cultures gave birth to the dynamic entity known as Anonymous. The term \u201canonymous\u201d originally referred to any internet user in general and their anonymous online identity and the term remains to do so. Anonymous, with a capital \u2018a,\u2019 arose from an internet <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\">meme</a> in 2003. It represented the mass of internet users whose activity was carried out anonymously via the web as a collective whole. Eventually, actions orchestrated across a variety of message boards and chat rooms perpetrated by members of these online communities legitimized the idea of Anonymous amongst the internet sub-cultures that Anonymous' members populated as well as the general public. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rubies-Costume-Co-4418-Vendetta/dp/B000UVGLHU/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t/179-8158924-1610652\">Guy Fawkes face mask</a> has become a semi-official symbol of the group.</p><h2>Problems and Purpose</h2><p>Anonymous is committed to defending free-speech, opposing censorship, promoting transparency and exposing corruption. Recent acts of Anonymous include; Anonymous challenging the <a href=\"http://www.ifpi.org/\">IFPI</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.riaa.com/\">RIAA</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.mpaa.org/\">MPAA</a> with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack\">DDoS</a> attacks in the wake of the Pirate Bay verdict and the shutdown of the filesharing site Megaupload. Anonymous taking action to protest <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act\">SOPA</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act\">PIPA</a>. Anonymous is currently involved in aiding Wikileaks with their operation.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Anonymous\u2019 existence as an internet meme started in 2003 across message boards and websites like <a href=\"http://ohinternet.com/4chan\">4chan</a> and eBaum\u2019s World. On these sites, users posted on message boards and image boards anonymously which led to the creation of the meme. The growth of the subcultures on these sites resulted in a proliferation of internet lingo, inside jokes, and the use of \u201cunderground\u201d methods of online communication such as <a href=\"http://ohinternet.com/IRC\">IRC</a>. Eventually the users gained a communal awareness that would come to be known as Anonymous. Anonymous lay dormant for several years, committing internet pranks and acts of vigilantism. It wasn\u2019t until 2008 that the group gained mass media attention when it declared \u201cwar\u201d on the Church of Scientology. Anonymous initiated Project Chanology which involved DDoS\u00a0attacks on Scientology websites, prank calls, and protests in cities around the world. Project Chanology was Anonymous\u2019 first dedicated large-scale operation. From here on, Anonymous would continue to become increasingly involved with hacktivist activities.</p><p>Since Project Chanology, Anonymous has remained political. After the rigged presidential election in Iran of June 2009, riots broke out. Anonymous aided Iranian hackers in keeping information flowing freely in and out of the country after the Iranian government attempted to censor news about the protests on the internet. Later in 2010, Anonymous hacked Sony\u2019s PSN network. In December of 2010, Anonymous allied with Wikileaks and struck at websites belonging to Amazon, Paypal, Mastercard, Visa, and the Swiss bank PostFinance with DDoS attacks. During the Arab Spring in 2011, Anonymous backed the revolutionary activities by hacking various government webisites and putting them offline. On February 5, 2011, Aaron Barr, the CEO of the security firm HBGary Federal announced that his firm had infiltrated Anonymous. In response Anonymous hacked the HBGary Federal website, took control of the company\u2019s email, erased files and took down the company\u2019s phone system.</p><p>As Anonymous grew, sub groups like LulzSec and PLF developed and the number of operations that Anonymous executed multiplied rapidly. Anonymous conducted twenty-three different operations over the course of 2011. These include supporting the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement\">Occupy movement</a> and Operation Darknet, where Anonymous wiped out forty child pornography sites. So far in 2012, Anonymous has conducted an unconfirmed nine to ten operations.</p><h2>Participation</h2><blockquote><p><strong>\u201c</strong>Anonymous is the first Internetbased superconsciousness. Anonymous is a group, in the sense that a flock of birds is a group. How do you know they\u2019re a group? Because they\u2019re travelling in the same direction. At any given moment, more birds could join, leave, peel off in another direction entirely.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013Chris Landers. Baltimore City Paper, April 2, 2008.</p></blockquote><p>Anyone can join Anonymous. The most simple way is to go online and download the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon\">Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)</a> software. Any computer with the LOIC loaded on it is made part of the botnet that Anonymous uses to conduct its DDoS attacks upon selected websites. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies consider the LOIC and other software that facilitates DDoS attacks illegal. Other ways to become more involved in Anonymous include visiting Anonymous related websites, following Anonymous Twitter profiles, participating in the real life protests related to Anonymous' causes and downloading an IRC client to become more deeply involved with Anonymous.</p><h2>Deliberation and Decisions</h2><p>Anonymous has no single leader. Members express personal opinions on issues they wish to pursue and the members of Anonymous decide whether of not it is a cause they themselves wish to undertake. Finding the right IRC channel to truly become part of Anonymous\u2019 deliberative process can be a complicated task for the everyday internet user. Learning one\u2019s way around IRC is only one of the challenges. Above normal knowledge of operating computers could be necessary and familiarity with the vast lexicon of the internet is a must have in order to reach areas where Anonymous' \u00a0deliberation takes place. Preexisting members are wary of newcomers due to the sensitivity and risk involved with the group\u2019s activities. Some members of Anonymous have greater decision making power than others, any sort of power structure within the group can only be speculated upon, but there is a distinction between members who are merely apart of the Anonymous and those who decide which targets are ultimately chosen. Not every decision Anonymous makes is unanimous. Members of Anonymous do not have to participate in an operation should the objective of the operation not align with their ideas.</p><h2>Influence and Effects</h2><p>Anonymous has brought about the first major unified internet movement to have effects in the real world. Anonymous has created a form of protest and civil-disobedience via the internet that has never been seen before, being able to lend tangible support to many different causes throughout the world. This is important because previously online activism could only be executed by highly skilled hackers with singular agendas. Anonymous has allowed the everyday web user to get involved with the only requirement being an internet connection. It has changed the dynamic of the overall online community as a whole because it has bridged part of the gap between the mainstream internet user and the underground internet user.\u00a0</p><h2>Analysis and Criticism</h2><p>Arrests have occurred and continue to occur as a result of being directly involved with Anonymous and utilizing the LOIC software to assist in the group\u2019s DDoS attacks. Research has shown that people who install the LOIC software on their computers are not actually remaining, in fact, anonymous. Internet users who employ the LOIC and don\u2019t go through an anonymization network or use IP-spoofing can be easily traced. A question has been raised whether the masses are part of the struggle or just pawns offering their computers to those hackers that know how to better protect themselves online. Questions have also been raised about whether or not Anonymous\u2019 actions truly help or do anything at all. When SOPA was being considered by the House of Representatives and PIPA in the Senate, members of the internet community said that Anonymous\u2019 attacks on the FBI and other websites were just hurting the anti-SOPA/PIPA cause. Critics called Anonymous\u2019 actions during the Arab Spring \u201carmchair activism,\u201d and wondered if they actually contributed the causes in any tangible way.</p><h2>Secondary Sources</h2><p>Mansfield-Devine, Steve. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353485811700848\">\"Hacktivism: assessing the damage\"</a>\u00a0in Network Security, Volume 2011, Issues 8, (2011): 5-13.</p>Aiko Pras, Anna Sperotto, Giovane C.

These local programs protect natural resources for future generations, provide public access to public waters and shores, and plan for water-dependent uses. They are created in partnership with the local community and the Department of Ecology, and must comply with the state Shoreline Management Act and Shoreline Master Program Guidelines. As mandated, over 260 local programs must be updated by 2014, focusing on providing a unique opportunity to create a positive future for Washington\u2019s shorelines.</p><p>SMP updates strive to meet goals and expectations to protect and conserve shoreline natural resources. This includes the protection of critical areas and habitats, while still accommodating reasonable and appropriate uses. The goal of these two objectives is to succeed with a minimum of no net loss to shoreline ecological functions and processes. (WAC 173-26-201(2)(c))</p><p>\u00a0</p><h2><strong>History and Early Challenges</strong></h2><p>\u00a0In 1971, the people of the State of Washington voted for the Shoreline Management Act (SMA). This ultimately created three primary purposes: 1) To protect ecological functions; 2) To accommodate appropriate uses; and 3) To maintain public access. The Shoreline Master Program (SMP) implements the policies of the SMA at the local level by regulating use and development along shorelines. The Department of Ecology is responsible for ensuring that the local SMP is consistent with the intent of the SMA, and has final approval authority.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0In 2003, the Washington State Legislature took a significant step to revitalize the 32-year-old SMA and increase the emphasis on environmental protection. The Legislature, stimulated by agreement from a wide range of environmental, business, and government interests, set out on an ambitious task. This new framework required 264 towns, cities, and counties across the state to update their Shoreline Master Programs by 2014.</p><p>In order to implement these legislative mandates,\u00a0the Department of Ecology adopted a new series of regulations known as the Shoreline Guidelines in 2004. These Guidelines were designed as state standards which local governments must follow in drafting their shoreline master programs. The Guidelines translate the broad policies of the Shoreline Management Act (RCW 90.58.020) into standards for regulation of shoreline uses. The state legislature directed Ecology in 1995 to update the guidelines, which had not been revised since 1972 and did not account for advancements in science and shoreline management practices nor the recent passage of Washington\u2019s Growth Management Act. Ecology proposed a first draft in 1999 and adopted a substantially revised draft in 2000 that was eventually challenged in court.</p><p>\u00a0Then-Governor Gary Locke and former Attorney General Christine Gregoire co-sponsored a year-long mediation effort in 2002 that culminated in a third draft, which was issued for public comment in July 2002. That proposal had the endorsement of all of the parties to the lawsuit, including the Association of Washington Business (representing a coalition of business organizations, cities and counties), the Washington Aggregates &amp; Concrete Association, the Washington Environmental Council (WEC) and other environmental organizations \u2013 all of whom were parties to the lawsuit. The final version was adopted December 17, 2003 and became effective January 17, 2004.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Ecology made additional amendments to the Guidelines between 2004 and 2011 in response to changes in state statute. \u00a0In 2011, Ecology amended the Guidelines in response to a 2007 statute (RCW 43.21A.681) that directed them to \u201cadopt, by rule\u201d guidance on geoduck aquaculture with advice from a Shellfish Aquaculture Regulatory Committee (SARC). Ecology adopted amendments to the Guidelines in February 2011 that include new provisions for commercial geoduck aquaculture. Ecology also completed additional housekeeping amendments to chapters 173-18, 20, 22, 26 and 27 WAC at that time.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h2><strong>Creation and Participant Selection</strong></h2><p>As part of a comprehensive update to the SMP of Kitsap County, a task-force of citizens with shoreline-related interests were to be selected to work with County staff to develop goals, policies, and to assist in recommending regulations on SMP issues that need to be updated.</p><p>In order to qualify for selection, the applicant must be a resident of Kitsap County and willing to commit the time necessary to complete the work of the task force; must be able to work respectfully in a group setting and contribute constructively to the dialog; must be open to a multitude of issues relating to the SMP Update; and and be willing to take into consideration the various needs of the community. No technical skills are required but certainly encouraged, and meetings may require up to three hours of sitting with breaks as appropriate.</p><p>The Kitsap County Board of Commissioners authorized the development of an SMP task-force and was funded to assist until June 30, 2011 or longer should sufficient resources be available. On March 8, 2010, the task-force plan was adopted and 20 citizens were selected by the Kitsap County Board of Commissioners, signed by then Chairperson Josh Brown and Commissioner Steve Bauer. \u00a0</p><p>These members would be responsible for reviewing Shoreline Master Program procedures and guidelines; read and discuss information provided regarding shoreline uses and functions; participate and actively engage in meetings; and make recommendations based on information in the group discussions.\u00a0</p><p>Federal, State and Local Natural Resource agencies and other stakeholders would be asked to share their expertise with the task force as needed. Once selected, the members would be obligated to participate in bimonthly meetings to discuss the community\u2019s vision for shoreline usage; and make recommendations regarding policies and regulations for the SMP Update. Task force members are expected to learn about and gain an understanding of shoreline issues in order to make sound recommendations.</p><p>Those 20 citizens selected were as follows:</p><p><strong>James Aho\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bob Benze \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Carrilu Thompson \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sunny Wheeler</strong></p><p><strong>Linda Atkisson \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ken Parker \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Susan Cruver \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jessica Coyle</strong></p><p><strong>Dave Nelson \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mike Ingham \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Michelle Filley \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tom Nevins</strong></p><p><strong>Jennifer Forbes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zachary Halls\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dan Fallstrom \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Art Castle</strong></p><p><strong>Michael Maddox \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Don Seavy \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rebecca Mars \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mike Ellis</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>These individual volunteers were selected due to the broad diversity of interest groups that they represent, ranging from local home-owners, teachers, students, attorneys, realtors, community activists, and organizations such as the Kitsap Alliance of Property Owners (KAPO).</p><p>\u00a0</p><h2><strong>Vision Statement of the SMP Task Force</strong></h2><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>Comply with legislative mandates including requirements for no net loss of shoreline\u00a0ecological functions and values</li></ul><ul><li>Protect private individual property rights consistent with the public interest</li></ul><ul><li>Create a shoreline stewardship program that fosters reasonable and appropriate shoreline uses while protecting valuable and fragile natural resources</li></ul><ul><li>Engage a wide variety of stakeholders, citizens and interests in developing goals and policies.</li></ul><ul><li>Integrate and support County development plans, policies, and regulations</li></ul><ul><li>Ensure predictability, accountability, and efficiency during shoreline development review and decision making</li></ul><ul><li>Have a strong scientific basis</li></ul><h3>\u00a0</h3><h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><p>Since the creation of the Shoreline Guidelines in 2004, the Department of Ecology has worked with local governments to fund and support comprehensive SMP updates as mandated by the State Legislature, including the SMP update within Kitsap County. \u00a0According to public records on behalf of the state, and the Department of Ecology, up to $650,000 has been allocated to Kitsap County in order to facilitate the SMP update;

Purpose</h3>The Backbone Campaign\u2019s goal is to give a voice to community members and the masses, alike, by way of \u201cArtful Activism\u201d (Backbone Campaign). \u00a0Through the teaching of non-violent techniques and strategies, the Backbone Campaign looks first to give individuals the tools to have an effective political voice, and second to implement those skills in a manner that generates a dialogue between political leaders and those that they represent. \u00a0Through the creation and utilization of \u201cinnovative messaging and political theater \u2026[as well as] creative tactics such as spectacle imagery and other festival arts, giant banners and puppets, flash mobs, music and other theatrical forms of non-violent direct action,\u201d the Backbone Campaign believes that they can restore a political voice to the American public.\u00a0\u201cThe Backbone Campaign awakens and inspires Americans to build a progressive movement, reclaim our government, and secure a future worthy of our children.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Mission Statement via <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7g04Mp-78U\"><em>Meet the Backbone Campaign</em></a><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3>The Backbone Campaign was conceptualized and set into motion by a group of artists on Vashon Island\u2014near Seattle, Washington\u2014in 2002. \u00a0Some of the initial goals of the project were to create signs to show politically motivated messages at freeway overpasses, and\u2014on a more national level\u2014market their creative skills and the concept of a Backbone Campaign to progressive movements in the Washington DC area. \u00a0However, after being met with less than satisfactory interest, the artists switched their focus to their own community, as well as other similarly progressive, grassroots organizations around the country. \u00a0In the Campaign\u2019s inaugural year, they gave out a series of \u201cBackbone\u201d awards\u2014<a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/media/conyers_award2__200.jpg\">featuring a golden spinal column</a>\u2014to the likes of Jim McDermott, Howard Dean, and Cynthia McKinney for their commitment to upholding progressive values in the face of great adversity.\u00a0\u00a0By 2004, the Backbone Campaign had created their own progressive platform, which they utilized to, \u201cintroduce progressive values and language into local and state party platforms through the 2004 caucus process and the 2004 DNC platform committee hearings\u201d (<em>Meet the Backbone Campaign</em>). \u00a0In 2004, the artists of the Backbone Campaign also created a <a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/slideshows/Guantanamo/images/DSC02702_JPG.jpg\">70-foot-long backbone puppet</a>, with a progressive platform item on each vertebra, which was used at demonstrations along the West Coast, eventually making it to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. \u00a0 Along with the spine, Backbone artists also created the \u201cBush and Co. Chain Gang\u201d\u2014giant puppet heads made in the likenesses of <a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/slideshows/ChainGangWAConvention/DSC05829.html\">Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush, wearing prison uniforms and shackles</a>. \u00a0In their effort to continue to promote accountability, the Campaign also gave out a number of \u201cSpine Awards\u201d to politicians and activists who had done work on a community scale. \u00a0They also created their \u201c\u2018Thank and Spank\u2019 citizen lobbying tools\u201d that presented representatives with \u201cSpine Cards\u201d when they stood up for progressive values or policies, or \u201cSpineless Citations\u201d when they voted against progressive principles. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In the eight years since, the Backbone Campaign has taken on many nationally relevant projects, and allied itself with similar organizations such as Move To Amend, the Puffin Foundation West, MoveOn.org, and Occupy Wall Street, in order to further achieve their goals. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Supporters and participants involved in the Campaign\u2019s work are quite varied, based on Backbone\u2019s goal to provide training, strategies, and \u201ccreative tactics\u201d to any who wish to communicate their discontent with politicians who refuse to stand firmly for the progressive ideals they\u2019ve committed to, or with companies that aim to exploit citizens or the environment. \u00a0Also, through their <em>Localize This!</em> Action Camp, the Backbone Campaign has made an effort to reach out especially to the Pacific Northwest\u2019s outdoor-oriented progressives, with a series of climbing and kayaking-based actions. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><ul><li><strong><em>Localize This!</em> Action Camp</strong></li></ul>\u00a0The <em>Localize This!</em> Action Camp is held every summer at a camping space on Vashon Island. \u00a0For a week, participants are taught, \u201cGrand Strategy &amp; Creative Tactics; Community Supported Organizer Skills; Action Planning &amp; Earned Media; Anti-Foreclosure, Eviction Protection &amp; Buy-back; Organizing from a Human Rights Framework; [Non-Violent Direct Action], Tripod, Blockades Training; Rappelling, Kayak Safety &amp; Water-Based Tactics; Giant Puppet &amp; Banner Building; Economic Democracy Strategies; Drumming, Flash Mobs and More.\u201d \u00a0The week generally culminates with an organized action relating to a current issue\u20142010\u2019s action was a critique of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that corporations could limitlessly fund political candidates, and featured a song and dance inside a Target, titled, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FhMMmqzbD8\">\u201cTarget Ain\u2019t People,\u201d</a> that generated over a million and a half views on YouTube. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0<ul><li><strong>Shared Sacrifice My Ass</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In August of 2011, the Backbone Campaign helped to organize an action in Seward Park, on the shores of Lake Washington, aimed at challenging Washington\u2019s most affluent individuals and corporations to \u201cshare [in] the economic sacrifices [of] working families\u201d (\u201cShared Sacrifice\u201d). \u00a0The action involved songs and dancing, and giant signs held airborne by balloons\u2014one of which showed a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/backbone_campaign/6068450874/in/set-72157627365221715/\">partially covered behind, and the words, \u201cSharedSacrificeMyAss.org.\u201d</a> \u00a0The sign was positioned across the lake from the Mercer Island estate of billionaire, Paul Allen, and targeted him and more of Washington\u2019s wealthiest who were fighting the implementation of a new state income tax. \u00a0For the project, the Backbone Campaign partnered with the Washington Community Action Network with the goal of showing the public that budget cuts for education and healthcare came as a result of middle and working class families having to take on too great of an economic burden. \u00a0The action attracted extensive attention from local news sources, as well as from other national, progressive, grassroots organizations.\u00a0<ul><li><strong>For the People Rally &amp; Summit</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In January, 2012, the Backbone Campaign teamed up with Occupy Wall Street for Occupy the Courts, in Washington DC, as a second annual protest of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision granting corporate personhood. \u00a0Although much smaller, the event\u2019s predecessor stirred up a great deal of media attention in local news and led to articles in several progressive magazines, creating momentum for the 2012 action. \u00a0According to Bill Moyer, Backbone Campaign\u2019s Executive Director, the 2012 action included, \u201cstreet theater, giant banners, and even light projections on the Supreme Court and the [headquarters] of the US Chamber of Commerce\u201d (\u201cCreativity &amp; Bold Action\u201d). \u00a0As a result of the publicity gained through this year\u2019s action, the Backbone Campaign received interviews from Seattle\u2019s National Public Radio affiliate and PunkPatriot.com.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<ul><li><strong>Action-In-A-Box: Corporate Personhood Action Toolkit</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In late 2011, the Backbone Campaign collaborated with MoveToAmend.org to bring media attention to the debate of corporate personhood. \u00a0The goal of the action was to encourage the action of other grassroots efforts and motivated individuals by making participation easy. \u00a0To achieve this, the organization teamed up with a number of independent, supportive artists and organizations to create \u201cAction-in-a-Box\u201d toolkits. \u00a0The toolkits included instructions and materials for a number of action-oriented projects, as well as information about the history of the fight against corporate personhood in America (\u201cCorporate Personhood\u201d). \u00a0\u00a0<ul><li><strong>The 99% Choir Goes Christmas Caroling\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\u00a0Just before Christmas in 2011, the Backbone Campaign partnered with the Other 98%, the Seattle Labor Chorus, and the Washington Community Action Network to bring a Christmas-themed action to the Bank of America Tower in Seattle, Washington, along with several other Bank of America and Wells Fargo locations. \u00a0The carolers sung songs to bank-goers and personnel, like, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AVzKPR52M0&amp;feature=player_embedded\">\u201cWe\u2019ll Foreclose, We\u2019ll Foreclose, We\u2019ll Foreclose\u201d and \u201cDeck the Jails with Wall Street Bankers,\u201d</a> and left fake foreclosure notices from the 99% on the walls, citing, \u201cBribery, Fraud, [and] Extortion\u201d (Kouril). \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<ul><li><strong>The Fight for Puget Sound\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In July of 2008, after months of fighting, Glacier Northwest received the right to begin building a 400-foot pier, over state-owned aquatic lands, which would allow them access to the 192-acre gravel mine they had purchased on Maury Island (Brown). \u00a0The Backbone Campaign and others in the opposition contended that the pier\u2019s construction would have too many negative environmental impacts; but, after an investigation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Glacier Northwest was allowed to continue. \u00a0In the following months, the legal battles continued, but legislation to protect Maury Island continued to fail on the State level. \u00a0During this time, the Backbone Campaign took an active role protesting,\u00a0in both the community and in the field, against\u00a0Glacier\u2019s advancements. \u00a0A group of kayakers\u2014dubbed \u201cThe Mosquito Fleet,\u201d and created to strategically hinder the progress of Glacier\u2019s water construction equipment\u2014made several appearances, earning local media attention. \u00a0\u00a0Through the start of 2009, actions led by the Backbone Campaign and the Mosquito Fleet to slow Glacier\u2019s progress continued, but going into the following spring, newly elected Governor Christine Gregoire remained unresponsive to Backbone\u2019s pleas for assistance. \u00a0At the start of the summer, the Backbone Campaign headed a petition demanding Gregoire\u2019s support, and warning of the intentions of that summer\u2019s Action Camp. \u00a0In July of 2009, with no compromise in sight, the Backbone Campaign teamed up with the Ruckus Society for another non-violent attack on Glacier\u2019s mining and construction operation\u2014during which, the Mosquito Fleet again did its job, hindering Glacier\u2019s abilities and generating media attention. \u00a0\u00a0Going into August, the Backbone Campaign and its collaborators had organized a rapid response team available 24/7 for actions against any incoming Glacier watercrafts. \u00a0At the End of August, Backbone\u2019s efforts paid off, as U.S. District Justice Ricardo Martinez ruled against the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 original environmental findings. \u00a0Over the next year, the battle for Maury Island continued in the courts, but after the King Country elections in November of 2010, CalPortland (Glacier\u2019s parent company) announced its agreement with the Cascade Land Conservancy and King County to sell the land to the public. \u00a0The result of the deal was the establishment of a 250-acre park\u2014the largest protected shoreline in the Puget Sound\u2014and a colossal victory for the Backbone Campaign and its supporters. \u00a0(\u201cTimeline to Victory\u201d)\u00a0<ul><li><strong>BP/Arco Boycott\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In the wake of the 2010 BP oil spill, the Backbone Campaign planned an action to boycott BP/Arco Stations in the Seattle Area, and to place a banner on the Interstate-5 Yesler overpass. \u00a0The Campaign\u2019s protest caught the attention of local news as well as the FOX Business channel. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGrPo6927F8&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Executive Director Bill Moyer went on FOX Business</a> to defend the boycott, and speak out against BP\u2019s political sponsorships and American dependence on foreign and domestic oil. \u00a0(\u201cBoycott of BP-ARCO\u201d) \u00a0\u00a0<p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction \u00a0</h3>The Backbone campaign is a collaboration between many individuals who donate their time and effort to promote the organization\u2019s success. \u00a0Below is a list of the Campaign\u2019s current staff, as listed by BackboneCampaign.org:\u00a0<ul><li>Executive Director: Bill Moyer</li><li>Managing Director: Yve Susskind</li><li>Project Organizer: Jared Middle Calf</li><li>Affiliated Artist/Puppetista: Christopher Lutter</li><li>Affiliated Artist: Steffon Moody</li><li>Affiliated NVDA Trainer: Logan Price</li><li>Board of Trustees:\u00a0President Stan Sorscher</li><li>Board of Trustees:\u00a0Treasurer Doug Skove</li><li>Board of Trustees:\u00a0Secretary Anne Gavzer</li><li>Board of Trustees: Trustee\u00a0John Sellers</li><li>Board of Trustees: Trustee\u00a0Jim Diers</li></ul><h2>Funding</h2><p>The Backbone Campaign, as a grassroots, non-profit organization, is funded by supporters\u2019 and participants\u2019 donations.</p><h3>Influences</h3><p>Through their constant commitment to create new actions, the organizers at the Backbone Campaign keep the organization, as well as similar organizations, in the political conversation. \u00a0The Backbone Campaign\u2019s strategies have been shown to be effective, and their work shows their commitment to improving and spreading those strategies. \u00a0\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><ol><li>Backbone Campaign. 21 Feb 2012 &lt;<a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/&gt;\">http://backbonecampaign.org/&gt;</a>.</li><li>Brown, Leslie. \"Glacier gets OK for Maury Island dock, opponents vow to keep fighting.\" 10 July 2008.

The project is carried out at the Social and Health Management Department at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Vaasa.</p><p><em><strong>Background</strong></em></p><p>Deliberative democracy can be seen as especially beneficial when the contemporary problems of health care are tackled. One distinct problem is the complex and inevitable issue of \u2018limited resources, unlimited demand\u2019. The existence of this gap between the demands and available resources cannot be denied or avoided. At the same time as the resource problems are getting worse, people\u2019s expectations for health care grow. At the municipal level, the decisions are made in the frame of representative democracy, i.e. based on the views of elected representatives and technocratic experts. However, as the allocation of scarce resources demands more and more compromises and sacrifices, it becomes meaningful to ask whether the public could be given a stronger role on tackling these highly wicked health care issues.</p><p>For example, the USA and UK have been implementing different forms of deliberative democracy. In Finland, so far these are almost non-existent. Few have been implement, but none of these have been targeted on health care issues. The objective of this research project is to gain scientific evidence of how and if the practices of deliberative democracy could be applied in the context of Finnish health care. The main research questions are as follows; <em>1) Can the applications of deliberative democracy serve as a way of expressing the citizen\u2019s voice in Finnish health care? We also have to ask; 2) what are the multidimensional elements of deliberative democracy, and how are they utilized in the health care of selected countries?</em> These can be divided into three interlinked research tasks (RT): to analyze and understand the multidimensional elements of deliberative democracy (RT1); to analyze the utilization of deliberative democracy models in the health care of selected countries (RT2); and to create and test a deliberative democracy model applicable to Finnish health care on the bases of theoretical framework and empirical study (RT3). The additional theoretical framework for the study consists of complexity theory, the concept of wicked problems and the idea of collective intelligence.</p><p><strong><em>Research methods and material</em></strong></p><p>Through comparative multidimensional evaluation model (MdE) the systems, models and applications of deliberative democracy in selected countries, i.e. UK and USA, are analyzed. Research\u2019s main data consists of citizens\u2019 survey (random sample of 5000), interviews of municipal authorities and the scientific test.

This reflexiveness can signal emerging problems, enabling what we call anticipatory governance \u2013 the ability of society and institutions to seek and understand a variety of inputs to manage emerging technologies while such management is still possible. Through this improved contextual awareness, we can help guide the path of nanotechnology knowledge and innovation toward more socially desirable outcomes and away from undesirable ones.</p><h3>History</h3><p>In 2005, the U.S. National Science Foundation\u00a0announced\u00a0a set of major grants in nanotechnology in society, including the creation of Centers for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University (CNS-ASU) and at the University of California, Santa Barbara (CNS-UCSB) to pursue scholarship on and methodological and theoretical approaches to the social studies of nanotechnology. With its $6.2 million award from NSF (# 0531194), CNS-ASU is the largest center for research, education and outreach on the societal aspects of nanotechnology in the world.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>CNS-ASU pursues its goals through two cross-cutting\u00a0<a href=\"http://cns.asu.edu/program/research.htm\">research</a>\u00a0programs: real-time technology assessment (RTTA), including such activity as analyzing research and innovation systems, surveying public opinion and values, creating opportunities for public deliberation and participation regarding nanotechnology decision-making, and evaluating the impact of CNS-ASU activities; and two thematic research clusters (TRC) that investigate equity and responsibility, and nanotechnology, sustainability and urban environments. CNS-ASU also administers the NSF-funded\u00a0<a href=\"http://cns.asu.edu/stir/\">STIR project</a>\u00a0(Socio-Technical Integration Research, #0849101), an international project that studies the extent to which collaborations between social and natural scientists working alongside one another in research laboratories may advance responsible innovation.\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>CNS-ASU organized the US's first large-scale public deliberative activity on a scientific topic - nanotechnology and human enhancement technologies. The National Citizens Technology Forum (NCTF), held in 2008, involved the full participation of 74 lay citizens in six locales. The citizens completed a pre-test, received a vetted background document, engaged in face-to-face and internet-mediated deliberations, wrote reports from each local group, and took a post-test. Central findings include both those about the substance of the citizens' views of nanotechnologies and human enhancement and those about the nature and quality of the citizens' deliberations. The general portrait of attitudes toward nanotechnologies for human enhancement that emerged was one that strongly suggests that popular unease with enhancement technologies exists alongside hope for nano-enabled therapies. The general portrait of deliberation that emerged was one that strongly supports the contention that lay citizens are capable of deliberating in a thoughtful way that can contribute to public discourse and even to policy decisions. <a href=\"http://cns.asu.edu/cns-library/author/?action=getfile&amp;file=88&amp;section=lib\">The full report is available online</a>.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>CNS-ASU is funded by the US National Science Foundation.</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>The CNS-ASU library, which includes references and many pdfs of all CNS-ASU publications, is <a href=\"http://cns.asu.edu/cns-library/\">online here</a>.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=\"http://cns.asu.edu/index.php\">CNS-ASU website.</a></p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": "nanotechnology||research||public engagement||public participation", "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University (CNS-ASU)", "methods": "Consensus Conference", "path": "/organizations/center-nanotechnology-society-arizona-state-university-cns-asu", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1200", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2012-06-21T19:08:50", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2012-06-21T19:03:13", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "605", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Canada", "content_country": "Canada", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>The goal of <a href=\"http://www2.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/index.page?\">GovTogetherBC</a> is to let citizens know what's being talked about in the province of British Columbia and plug you into ways you can get involved.

Rosell. Since 1999 Viewpoint Learning has designed and conducted public and private dialogues in the United States, Canada and Europe.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Viewpoint Learning specializes in designing and conducting dialogues on \"complex and challenging issues\" for public and private settings. Viewpoint Learning has developed five dialogue methods intended to guide participants from superficial and unstable attitudes and beliefs about an issue to deeper, more substantial, more stable, more nuanced, and values-based attitudes and beliefs about the issue.</p><p>Several of these methods are characterized by a three-stage structure and the use of \"scenarios\" or broad policy approaches that are related to values held by the participants or the public. Viewpoint Learning often calls the stages of the three-stage structure: (1) \"Opinion Formation,\" (2) \"Working Through,\" and (3) \"Resolution.\"</p><p>These methods include:</p><ul><li>Strategic Dialogue and Scenario Development</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choice-Dialogue</a> (formerly called <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue</a>)</li><li>Stakeholder Dialogue</li><li>Community Conversations</li><li>Online Dialogue,\u00a0Online Surveys, and Online Conversation</li></ul><p><em><u>Strategic Dialogue and Scenario Development</u></em></p>\"Strategic Dialogue\" and \"Scenario Development,\" as applied to complex public policy issues, are methods by which governmental, business, and community leaders may create several broad policy approaches that are related to important values that large numbers of the public are believed to hold, and so are likely to enjoy broad public support. The goal of a Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session about a public policy issue is to help civic leaders establish common ground with citizens\u00a0about the policy issue.<p>The following description of Strategic Dialogue and Scenario Development is based on Viewpoint Learning's account of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/commonground-first-five-years-dialogue-early-childhood-new-mexico\">the December 2009 CommonGround Strategic Dialogue</a>.</p><p>In a Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session about a public policy issue 35 to 40 governmental, business, and community leaders meet face-to-face and in-person in a four-hour session to discuss the issue and develop multiple policy approaches to address the issue.</p><p>Before the Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session is held, the convenors of the session meet to research public opinion about the issue, important values held by the public that are related to the issue, policy approaches to the issue, the community in which the session will take place,\u00a0and political, economic, social, and other dimensions of the issue.</p><p>Using this information the convenors create several (sometimes five or six) broad policy approaches, each of which is related to an important value held by large numbers of the relevant public. Such policy approaches generally describe sets of policy instruments and do not define policy objectives. Viewpoint Learning calls such policy approaches \"values-based approaches.\" \u00a0In its Strategic Dialogues\u00a0Viewpoint Learning uses \"values-based approaches\" rather than knowledge-based policy approaches because a goal of the Strategic Dialogue method is to help civic leaders establish common ground about policy issues with citizens, most of whom are said to make policy decisions on the basis of values rather than knowledge. For a Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session Viewpoint Learning develops multiple \"values-based approaches\" -- each of which reflects a different social perspective -- respecting the issue being discussed, in order to enable participants to consider the issue from multiple social perspectives.</p><p>Participants in a Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session are selected by the convenors, and are not chosen by means of random sampling.</p><p>A Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session begins with a brainstorming session, during which participants are asked (A) to identify the most important \"changes and trends\" respecting the issue being discussed in the relevant jurisdiction during a particular time period (e.g., the past 20 years), and (B) to predict likely social, economic, and other relevant outcomes in the jurisdiction a decade in the future, assuming no policy changes are made respecting the issue being discussed.\u00a0</p><p>During the next part of the Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session, participants meet in small groups and plenary sessions to discuss the \"values-based approaches\" prepared by the convenors, in light of the changes, trends, and predicted outcomes that participants identified during the first part of the session. Among other topics these discussions concern the advantages and disadvantages participants associate with each \"values-based approach\" and similarities and differences between the approaches.</p><p>After the Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development session has concluded, the convenors analyze the results and reduce the five or six \"values-based approaches\" to a smaller number of \"scenarios.\" \u00a0A \"scenario\" is an account combining a description of a broad policy approach -- or set of policy instruments -- that is related to important values believed to be held by a large portion of the relevant community, with descriptions of \u00a0advantages and disadvantages associated with that approach. Scenarios may be used by governmental, business, or community leaders to make policy decisions, or as the basis for policy dialogues among citizen participants, such as <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogues</a> or Online Dialogues.</p><p>It is unclear what decision-making method is used in Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development\u00a0(e.g., consensus, voting, survey, etc.).</p><p><em><u><a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choice-Dialogue</a> (or <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue)</a></u></em></p><p>For a description of this method, see <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">the Participedia article on Choicework Dialogue</a>.</p><p><em><u>Stakeholder Dialogue</u></em></p><p>The following description of the Stakeholder Dialogue method is based on the method used in The Future of Housing in San Mateo Stakeholder Dialogue.</p><p>Viewpoint Learning's Stakeholder Dialogue method is used in a continous 8-hour face-to-face, in-person discussion session. Most of the participants in a Stakeholder Dialogue are governmental, business, and other community leaders. Participants may also include some citizens -- often participants in preceding Choicework Dialogue(s) about the same issue in the same jurisdiction -- and issue-advocates. The total number of participants in a Stakeholder Dialogue is uncertain. Participants in a Stakeholder Dialogue appear to be chosen by the convenors of the dialogue and are not randomly selected.</p><p>A Stakeholder Dialogue is usually held after one or more <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogues</a> have been held on the same issue in the same jurisdiction. The Stakeholder Dialogue content usually refers extensively to the results of the preceding <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue(s)</a>.</p><p>A Stakeholder Dialogue is usually divided into three stages:</p><ol><li>Stakeholder Dialogue participants discover \"common ground\u00a0between ... their own perspectives,\" on the one hand, and the \"vision of the future\" and the preferred policy scenarios that had resulted from the preceding <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue(s)</a>, on the other.</li><li>From that \"common ground\" the Stakeholder Dialogue participants develop \"a shared vision\" or set of ultimate policy goals and broad policy approaches.</li><li>Stakeholder Dialogue participants then choose several \"high-leverage goals\" -- i.e., achievable policy objectives -- intended to bring about the \"shared vision,\" and begin to create plans for achieving those \"high-leverage goals.\"</li></ol><p>During each of these stages, participants engage in small-group and plenary discussions moderated by trained facilitators.</p><p>It is unclear what method of decision making is used in Stakeholder Dialogue (e.g., consensus, voting, survey, etc.).</p><p><em><u>Community Conversations</u></em></p><p>The following description of the Community Conversations method is based on the method used in the 2010 Anchorage Community Conversations.</p><p>Viewpoint Learning's Community Conversation method is used in a 3-hour-long, public, face-to-face, in-person discussion session to which all members of the relevant community are invited. Participants are not randomly selected and the number of participants varies. (Nonetheless, for certain Community Conversation events the convenors will hold a special Community Conversation session in which participants come from a sample that is randomly selected and then adjusted to be representative of the population of the community. The convenors will then compare the demographics and results of the randomly selected session with demographics and results from the other sessions, in order to detect bias and for other purposes.) For purposes of inclusiveness multiple Community Conversation events are often held about the same issue in different locations in the same community over a period of weeks.\u00a0</p><p>Before a Community Conversation is held the convenors create draft informational materials describing the policy issue and three or four broad policy approaches for addressing the issue. Governmental, business, labor, religious, and other community leaders review and comment on the draft informational materials, which are then revised to reflect those comments, and finalized.</p><p>During each Community Conversation four topics are discussed:</p><ul><li>A vision of the future of the community respecting the policy issue being discussed. (This vision\u00a0reflects\u00a0ultimate policy objectives);</li><li>Policy approaches designed to achieve that vision;</li><li>Funding methods for the policy approaches;</li><li>Tradeoffs between policy\u00a0approaches and funding methods, that are necessary in order to implement feasible policies that achieve the vision of the future.</li></ul><p>Each Community Conversation is divided into two discussion sessions, each of which includes small-group discussions followed by a plenary discussion. The small-group discussions and plenary discussions are moderated by trained facilitators.</p><p>During the first discussion session participants discuss their vision of the future for the community, the policy approaches, and the funding methods. During the second discussion session participants discuss tradeoffs among policy approaches and funding methods necessary in order to implement feasible policies.</p><p>After the second discussion session participants complete a survey measuring their attitudes about the policy approaches and funding methods they have discussed.</p><p><u><em>Online Dialogue, Online Survey, and Online Conversation</em></u></p><p>The following description of the Online Dialogue method is based on the method used in <em>Voices for Health Care</em>.</p><p>Viewpoint Learning uses two types of Online Dialogue: Online Choice-Book and Online Dialogue Groups.</p><p>The Online Choice-Book method is usually used in conjunction with the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue</a>. In Online Choice-Book, the organizers create an online version of the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue</a> workbook, which\u00a0describes:</p><ul><li>a small number of important dimensions or sub-issues of the principal policy issue being discussed</li><li>the facts related to those sub-issues</li><li>up to four \"scenarios\"</li><li>advantages and disadvantages of each \"scenario,\" and</li><li>several options for funding each scenario.\u00a0</li></ul><p>A \"scenario\" is a relatively broad policy approach that is related to particular values believed to be held by large numbers of the relevant public. \u00a0A \"scenario\" is an account combining a description of a broad policy approach -- or set of policy instruments -- that is related to important values believed to be held by a large portion of the relevant community, with descriptions of \u00a0advantages and disadvantages associated with that approach. \u00a0A \"scenario\" generally does not describe policy objectives.\u00a0The Online Choice-Book is then placed on an Internet-based platform, such as Citizen Compass.</p><p>Participants for Online Choice-Book are not randomly selected. Participants are invited through \"advertising\u00a0and outreach\" on \"websites,\" in \"af\ufb01nity\u00a0groups,\" and on social media sites. The number of participants in a typical Online Choice-Book dialogue varies. For example, the Voices for Health Care Online Choice-Book began with 555 participants of whom 368 completed the Choice-Book. It is unclear how long an Online Choice-Book typically remains open for participation.</p><p>The Online Choice-Book experience is a 30-minute-long online session which may \"be\u00a0completed either all at once or in several sittings.\"\u00a0At the beginning of the session each participant completes a survey asking for the participant's demographic information and measuring the participant's attitudes about the scenarios and funding options. The participant then reads through the Choice-Book, and finally completes a second survey measuring the participant's attitudes about the scenarios and funding options. \u00a0</p><p>An Online Dialogue Groups event usually takes place after an Online Choice-Book experience has concluded. Participants in an Online Dialogue Groups event consist of individuals who have previously participated in an Online Choice-Book. \u00a0The purpose of an Online Dialogue Groups event is \"to identify and discuss\" concrete policy approaches that\u00a0should be used to address a major policy issue \"and search for common ground.\"\u00a0</p><p>An Online Dialogue Groups event usually occurs on an Internet-based platform, such as Citizen Compass, that permits moderated discussion.</p><p>Participants in an Online Dialogue Groups event appear to be self-selected from among participants in an earlier Online Choice-Book session. \u00a0Participants are then assigned to groups having approximately 25 members each. Viewpoint Learning describes these groups as \"randomized\" so as to be \"as diverse as possible in terms of gender,\u00a0age and income.\"</p><p>Before each Online Dialogue Group event begins the organizers choose three discussion topics, which appear to consist of two policy goals and one set of funding mechanisms.</p><p>An Online Dialogue Group event lasts for seven days. During that week participants may post messages to their group at any time. Each group discussion is moderated.</p><p>Participants may view, but may not contribute to, the discussion in groups other than their own. This allows the dissemination of ideas across groups.</p><p>During Online Dialogue Group discussions participants discuss concrete policy approaches for achieving the two policy goals, as well as means of funding those policy approaches. Participants spend two days discussing policy approaches for achieving the first policy goal, two days discussing policy approaches for achieving the second policy goal, two days discussing means of funding the policy approaches, and the last day reaching \"common ground\" on policy approaches and funding mechanisms.</p><p>It is unclear what decision making method is used on the final day of the Online Dialogue Group event.</p><p>The following description of the Online Survey method is based on the method used in the survey called <em>Californians and their Relationship to Government</em>.</p><p>An Online Survey generally measures respondents' attitudes about a political issue. For an Online Survey Viewpoint Learning gathers what it refers to as a \"random representative sample\" of approximately 1,020 respondents. Respondents are \"recruited from a range of panels, intercept interviews and from social media.\" Results have a margin of error of 3.1% at the 95% confidence level.</p><p>The following description of the Online Conversation method is based on the method used in <em>California\u2019s Community Clinics and Health Centers: The Online Conversation</em>.</p><p>Online Conversation is not a public discussion method but a data-mining and analysis method. In Online Conversation researchers retrieve online public comments about the issue being researched, by conducting keyword searches related to the issue on major Internet search engines and social media sites.</p><p>Results are filtered using pre-established criteria. Comments in the final results set are then categorized by sentiment and topic. Topics are identified from the comments themselves, not from a pre-established taxonomy. Next, researchers analyze the topics to identify similarities and differences between the topics. From this analysis researchers identify several \u201cthemes,\u201d each of which corresponds to multiple related topics. Researchers then analyze the comments a second time by associating each comment with the themes expressed in it. The themes are then ranked by the frequency with which they are associated with comments.\u00a0</p><p>In Online Conversation neither the commenters nor the comments are randomly selected, and nothing is known about the demographic or other attributes of the commenters.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>Some of the major dialogues that Viewpoint Learning has designed or conducted include:</p><p><em><u>Using the Strategic Dialogue or Scenario Development method:</u></em></p><ul><li>California\u2019s Community Clinics and Health Centers: Dialogues (2011)</li><li>Canada Task Force for the Payments System Review:\u00a0Scenarios for the Future of the Canadian Payments System (2010-2011)</li><li>The Future of Non-Profit Health Care: Engaging Leaders in Minnesota, New York and Texas (2007)</li><li>Making Trust a Competitive Asset: Breaking Out of Narrow Frameworks: [Strategic Dialogue for Senior Corporate Executives] (2003)</li><li>\"Our Voices, Our Children\": A Strategic Dialogue on Early Childhood Development\u00a0with Leaders in New Mexico (2009)</li></ul><p><em><u>Using the Choicework Dialogue method:</u></em></p><ul><li>Beyond Wishful Thinking: Californians Deliberate State Budget Reform (2008)</li><li>California Citizen Dialogues on K-12 Education Reform (2007)</li><li>Citizen Dialogues on Covering the Uninsured (2004)</li><li>Citizen Dialogues on Paying for Health Care in Retirement (2008)</li><li>Citizen Dialogues on the Coming of Age in Arizona (2003)</li><li>Citizens' Dialogue on Canada\u2019s Future (2002)</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada\">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a> (2002)</li><li>Citizens' Dialogue on the Long-term Management of Used Nuclear Fuel in Canada (2004)</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/commonground-first-five-years-dialogue-early-childhood-new-mexico\">CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico</a> (2010)</li><li>Facing Up to Our Nation's Finances: Changing Expectations: Americans Deliberate Our Nation\u2019s Finances and Future (2006-2007)</li><li>The Future of Housing in San Mateo: Citizen Dialogues (2003)</li><li>The Future of the San Diego Region\u2019s Airport: Choice-Dialogues with County Residents (2004)</li><li>Health Coverage for All Arizonans: Citizen Dialogues (2005)</li><li>Health Coverage for All Californians: Dialogues with the Public (2005-2006)</li><li>Listening to Californians: California Citizens' Dialogues about California's Government (2004)</li><li>San Diego Dialogues on Community Water Fluoridation (2005-2007)</li><li>Sustainability Research Initiative: Listening to the Public: Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Sustainability: [Vancouver Choice-Dialogues] (2005)\u00a0</li><li>Voices for Health Care: Engaging the Public to Advance Signi\ufb01cant Health Care Reform (2008)</li></ul><p><em><u>Using the Stakeholder Dialogue method:</u></em></p><ul><li>California Citizen Dialogues on K-12 Education Reform (2007)</li><li>Facing up to Our Nation's Finances: Changing Expectations: Americans Deliberate Our Nation\u2019s Finances and Future (2007)</li><li>The Future of Housing in San Mateo: Stakeholder Dialogues (2004)</li><li>Voices for Health Care: Engaging the Public to Advance Signi\ufb01cant Health Care Reform (2008)</li></ul><p><em><u>Using the Community Conversations method:</u></em></p><ul><li>Anchorage Community Conversations (2010)</li><li>The Future of K\u201312 Education in Anchorage: Community Conversations (2012)</li><li>Salinas Community Dialogues (2009)</li></ul><p><em><u>Using the Online Dialogues, Online Surveys, or Online Conversation method:</u></em></p><ul><li>California\u2019s Community Clinics and Health Centers: The Online Conversation (2009-2011)</li><li>Californians and Their Relationship to Government: [Online Survey] (2010)</li><li>Citizen\u00a0Dialogue on Education Reform (2008) [Online Component of: California Citizen Dialogues on K-12 Education Reform]</li><li>The Future of the San Diego Region\u2019s Airport: On-line Dialogue (2005)</li><li>Public Voices for Housing Choices: An Online Dialogue on the Future of Housing in San Mateo County (2008)</li><li>Voices \u2029for \u2029Health \u2029Care: Online\u2029 Dialogue\u2029 and Choicebook (2008)</li></ul><h3>Funding</h3><p>Funding for a Viewpoint Learning dialogue usually comes from the organization sponsoring the dialogue.

They just don't want to join street protests, parties, etc.</p><p>Freerz Community is a means for Them to be able to fight for worthy causes - in the virtual world - without associating themselves with any real-world entities.</p><p>Our world view is simple: <strong>All is One - One is All - All is All</strong>.</p><h3>History</h3><strong>Until its Dawning - a history of oppression and hope</strong>\u00a0It was \u00a0the \u00a0mid-sixties in Central-Europe, when the then-Hungarian\u00a0People's Army started issuing new uniforms to its troops.The old uniform was a soviet lookalike,contrary to the newly issued one,that represented some traditional \u00a0Hungarian look. This move, that occured in 1965, ended a decade of bitter memories of the famous 1956 Uprising.However invading soviet forces were still in place, but at least distinction between the soviet and hungarian soldiers became possible. Naturally, this move was aimed at the \u00a0general \u00a0population to hide the \u00a0oppressive nature of the regime,but interestingly it caused the most effect to those,who intended to wear these, the soldiers, or at least, a part of them.\u00a0In Hungary, as in most countries those days, a mandatory draft systemwas in effect. According to this,all males between the ages of 18 and 36 were subject to \u00a0military service. As with most mandatory regulations in most countries, it usually only applied to the poor. Party members' sonswere \u00a0transferred to \u00a0more \u00a0convenient \u00a0places, while \u00a0those \u00a0dubbed \u00a0as 'enemies-of-the-system' were dispatched to near-labour camps,referred to as 'Engineering Brigades'. The difference between the poor and the rich, and between the \u00a0sons of the ruling elite and the \u00a0ordinary folk were so obvious, that it was crystal clear for everyone.\u00a0To add more pressure for those, who served their country a system ofpolitical \u00a0comissariat \u00a0was \u00a0working alongside \u00a0each units. A \u00a0political officer was operating at company-level -this meant that a party comissar overlooked \u00a0the daily \u00a0life of the \u00a0units. At least \u00a0one such \u00a0spook was assigned to \u00a0every 50-100 men. For an Army of \u00a0some 120-200.000 it meanthell of a \u00a0high level of \u00a0suspicion, one might say. Needless \u00a0to say, as oppressive \u00a0regimes go, no opposition parties \u00a0or even \u00a0thoughts \u00a0were allowed to exist, neither in the public, nor in the armed forces.\u00a0These \u00a0factors \u00a0altogether \u00a0created an \u00a0atmosphere \u00a0of \u00a0suspicion and untrustworthyness. Hence these developments,social groups tended to stick together while on service.Because of the high level of surveillance they encountered, they were secretly aligned into \u00a0small cells. The first of such groups was the 'Rural Brotherhood', composed of agrarian-background fellow \u00a0countrymen. Of course, being subject to martial law as soldiers, they weren't keen to commit anything that \u00a0might be seen as an open revolt or such.\u00a0\u00a0Over the decades \u00a0these \u00a0secretive \u00a0groups \u00a0transformed \u00a0into \u00a0secret\u00a0societies, and divided along their \u00a0common interests and goals. A number of these \u00a0operated pretty \u00a0secretive nets of cells at almost every unit. There were \u00a0ones that operated in \u00a0order to help each other to dissidate to the \u00a0West, others were \u00a0centered \u00a0on \u00a0defending \u00a0each \u00a0other against offences. Finally there were some, whose members were trying to make the most of \u00a0their \u00a0stay: \u00a0writing \u00a0 memoires, engaging \u00a0in \u00a0philosophical discussions in order to 'Change the World'.\u00a0Such groups would probably \u00a0end up in discontent, but as \u00a0its members\u00a0were \u00a0changed every \u00a0one to three years, there were \u00a0always \u00a0fresh blood - and fresh ideas. After nearly fourty years,the Cold War came to an end, and these groups also - however their legacy continued.\u00a0From around 1989,these societies were transformed their thoughts ontoa whole \u00a0other theater: the \u00a0post-Internet World. In August of 2001, thelast such society ceased to exist,with the discharge of its last members from \u00a0the \u00a0now \u00a0democratic \u00a0Hungarian Defence Forces. \u00a0This \u00a0last secret society was named \u00a0<em>'The Rabapon-E Brotherhood</em>'. (Its name derived from a strong industrial cleaning solvent that was used at the army barracks at that time.)\u00a0\u00a0The former Members of the Rabapon-E created the Freerz Community and spread the light to three continents. Before going online, the Freerz had Units in Australia, Canada, UK, Italy, Germany, Austria and Hungary.<h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Freerz Community has specialist Units under development, but basically most Members are engaging in all kinds of tasks.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3>To name a few recent projects:\u00a0\u00a0There was a project a few months back where separate FRZ units (one in Australia, one in Canada, one in Italy and one in Hungary) researched immigration &amp; indigenous reaction to the immigration. Contrary to most such researches We did not focused on socio-political factors, but the access to resources by the various groups. The research concluded that the immigration and the violent xenophobic phenomenon are both based on the lack of access to resources and information. The exiles/refugees are usually denied access to resources and information at the starting point of their journey, while those sounding xenophobic voices are too lacking reliable information (and as such resources) about those coming into their countries. Of course there are many more circumstances that are effecting this issue, but We managed to prove valid points that were put into practice by some western countries immigration laws since.\u00a0Also a Freerz Unit was specifically designed a framework structure for an international disaster relief/response model that could be quickly activated, logistically feasible and staffed with eager and trained volunteers. Parts of this latter project were implemented in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake in 2010.<h3>Funding</h3><p>The Freerz Comunity is a non-profit organization and has no funding plans.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://freerz.org\">http://freerz.org</a></p><h1>(We strongly advise to read the Freerz Manifesto first, in order to understand the core principles We believe in. <a href=\"http://freerz.org\">http://freerz.org</a>)</h1>", "geo_city": "", "tags": "Freerz||Freerz Community||Freerz Manifesto", "geo_province": "", "title_en": "The Freerz Community", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/freerz-community", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1563", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"tri-f_1_0.PNG\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2012-07-05T14:30:07", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2012-07-05T14:30:07", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "620", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": null, "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Urban Planning Aid", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/urban-planning-aid", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1201", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2012-07-05T14:31:54", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2012-07-05T14:31:54", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "621", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": null, "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Greater Boston Committee", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/greater-boston-committee", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1201", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2012-07-13T07:06:29", "volunteer_count": "50", "geo_street": "322 NW Sixth Ave<br />Suite 200", "executive_director": "Fitz Ryland", "post_date": "2012-07-13T06:39:08", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": null, "geo_postal_code": "97209", "id": "624", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Collective Agency", "geo_country": "United States", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": "$200,000", "part-time_staff": "2", "issue": "Education &amp; Schools||Economic Development||Community Development||Human Rights||Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p><em>A supportive and nurturing place to work alongside people doing work they\u2019re passionate about and committed to.</em></p><h3>History</h3><p>Collective Agency is a representative democracy business located in Portland Oregon.</p>Alex Linsker, who started it June 15th 2011, was term-limited as the main community organizer; he transferred control on June 15th 2012 to Fitz Ryland, who was elected by members.<h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>There are more than 50 members and growing, and many forms of civic engagement, from Lightning Talks to council and civics meetings, yoga to advice.

As pioneer in the field of web-based dialogues, the company has sought to create and optimize cross-media communication between citizens and state for over ten years. Zebralog designs, organizes, implements, moderates, and evaluates a wide range of participation processes, from participatory urban planning projects over participatory budgeting, to debates on legislative procedures at the federal level. As a consultancy, Zebralog strives to enable private and public organizations to enter into a dialogue with citizens. As an agency, the company takes care of the technical implementation, and as an institute, Zebralog conducts research projects and provides expert opinions.</p><h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>Zebralog's goal is socio-political dialogue between citizens and state at eye-level. Based on the belief in the power of good ideas that grow from the bottom, the company seeks to strengthen democratic processes through greater citizen participation. Zebralog has formulated a number of guidelines for 'good participation': <a href=\"http://www.zebralog.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">www.zebralog.com/guidelines</a>.</p><h3>History</h3><p>When the founders of Zebralog met, the term \"online dialogue\" did not exist yet, at least not in Germany. At the end of the nineties, Matthias Tr\u00e9nel was investigating the success factors of discursive practices on the Internet at the Social Science Research Center in Berlin. Oliver M\u00e4rker was working for GMD Research Center for Information Technology (now Fraunhofer Institute IAIS) in research projects to develop software that visualizes and structures argumentation. Hans Hagedorn was working as moderator of social discourse for the Hammerbacher consulting firm. When the three met each other at a workshop in 1999, entrepreneurial spirit was in the air. They were bursting with ideas and together developed visions of collaborative processes in politics, the Internet and society - inspired by ideas from urban planning over psychology to IT.</p><p>First projects for the city of Esslingen and the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development, as well as numerous publications followed. At this point of time, Daniela Riedel, who was working with Hans Hagedorn at the Internet Start Up City&amp;Bits, joined the team. In 2003, the newly expanded team registered their non-profit association under the name of Zebralog e.V. This allowed them to further develop online dialogues for the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development as well as for other cities, state offices and ministries. Research institutes commissioned Zebralog e.V. with studies on e-participation. In 2007 the company started to transform the registered non-profit association Zebralog e.V. into a corporation and had become pioneers and experts in e-participation. To date, they are pioneers in shaping the digital society.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Zebralog offers comprehensive expertise from a single source. The organization provides individual advice throughout the whole participation process: from conception to implementation and evaluation. Experienced online moderators structure the discussion and promote issue-oriented dialogue. The dialogue is continued at meetings, workshops and tours of the site. By consolidating and evaluating the results, Zebralog produces a detailed, goal-oriented image that accounts for different perspectives. Also see: <a href=\"http://www.zebralog.com/services\" target=\"_blank\">www.zebralog.com/services </a></p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>Zebralog has conducted more than 100 participation projects, notably municipal dialogues, participatory budgeting and eConsultations.\u00a0</p><ul><li>The <strong>Cologne participatory budgeting</strong> (<a href=\"https://buergerhaushalt.stadt-koeln.de/2012/\" target=\"_blank\">http://buergerhaushalt.stadt-koeln.de</a>) has won several national and international awards. The city of Cologne introduced its first participatory budget in 2008, becoming one of the first cities in Germany to do so. Every year since then, the citizens of Cologne have been given the chance to voice their ideas as well as to rate and comment on others\u2019 suggestions concerning the best ways to spend and save money. In cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (Dr. Josef Wehner), Zebralog designs and realizes the Cologne participatory budgets.</li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>cross-media municipal dialogue \"Dresdner Debatte\"</strong> aimed at large-scale citizen participation regarding the structural development of Dresden's urban areas, particularly the central square that surrounds the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), an area known as the Neumarkt (New Market). The website <a href=\"http://www.dresdner-debatte.de/\">www.dresdner-debatte.de</a>, an online forum open from June 8 to July 8, 2010, gave anyone interested in the debate a chance to weigh in with their opinion. Extensive information informed website visitors about the history and architecture of the Neumarkt. They could publish their ideas and wishes for the historic heart of the city by submitting their own proposal, or by joining discussions others\u2019 proposals. In addition to the online platforms, an information box was set up on-site at the Neumarkt, in which citizens could ask questions and discuss their ideas and concerns with experts from the urban planning department of Dresden. In 2012, the project received a special award for \"sustainable participation\" at the administration congress \"Effizienter Staat\".</li></ul><ul><li>In 2011, Zebralog conducted an <strong>eConsultation among students</strong> on behalf of the Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the Land North Rhine-Westphalia.

Its main responsibilities include evaluating the 2010 United States Census and determining new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate\">Senate</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly\">Assembly</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Board_of_Equalization_%28California%29\">Board of Equilization</a> districts accordingly.</p><h3>History</h3><p>The commission was created in November 2008 following the passage of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_11_%282008%29\">Proposition 11</a> in California (also known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_11_%282008%29\">Voters First Act</a>). In 2010, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_20_%282010%29\">Proposition 20</a> (also known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_20_%282010%29\">Voters First Act for Congress</a>) was proposed to the people of California. Proposition 20's passage assigned the responsibility of redrawing the states Congressional District boundaries to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission also following the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_US_Census\">2010 United States Census</a>. The Commission faced opposition from incumbent California politicians because \"many safe seats in the Legislature could suddenly become compeititve. [6]</p><p>The Constitution requires that the commission have 14 members, comprised of three groups of registered voters\u20145 who are registered with the largest political party in the state, 5 who are registered with the second largest political party in the state, and 4 who are not registered with either of these parties. The commissioners were selected in November and December 2010 and were required to complete the redistricting by August 15th, 2011. Actions by the commission to adopt (or \u201ccertify\u201d) district boundaries require the approval of nine commissioners, including at least three \u201cyes\u201d votes from each of the three groups of commissioners.<a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2012/40_11_2012.aspx\">[1]</a></p><h3>Commission Selection and Processes</h3><p><em><strong>Commission Application</strong></em></p><p>After the passage of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_11_%282008%29\">Proposition 11</a> in November 2008, the <a href=\"http://www.bsa.ca.gov/\">California Bureau of State Audits</a> (BSA) adopted the regulations on October 20th, 2009. This paved the way for the Applicant Review Panel to be randomly selected on November 16th, 2009. The website wedrawthelines.ca.gov opened soon after with an application to be on the commission. The application open on December 15th, 2009 and was available through February 16th, 2010. Soon after, the BSA decides added new regulations that stipulated that the first eight commissioners sleected would interview and decide on the remaining six.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.bsa.ca.gov/\">California State Auditor</a> estimates that over 30,000 applications were recieved for the commision. After preliminary eliminations of incomplete applications, a secondary application was sent out to those who applied on the February 17th, 2010 and was available until April 19th, 2010. 5,000 applications were resubmitted and from those a three-member panel from the BSA reviews the applications and conducted interviews to establish a pool of 20 Democrats, 20 Republicans and 20 applicants from neither major party. This list of 60 names was forwarded to the California State Legislature on September 29th, 2010.</p><p>After the 60 finalists' names were recieved, the California Assembly Speaker, the California Senate President Pro Tempore, and the minority leaders of both the Assembly and the Senate jointly reduced the pool to 12 members within each classification as required by law. The Legislature sent this list of names on November 12th, 2010 back to the State Auditor who then randomly drew three Democrats, three Republicans and two applicants of neither major party to become commissionsers. These eight commissioners were notified over thier selection on November 18th, 2010 and were quickly taked with selecting the other six commissioners from the remaining pool by December 15th, 2010.</p><p><strong><em>Selected Commissioners</em></strong></p><p>Executive Director</p><ul><li>Daniel Claypool</li></ul><dl><dt>Democrats</dt></dl><ul><li>Gabino Aguirre</li><li>Angelo Ancheta</li><li>Maria Blanco</li><li>Cynthia Dai</li><li>Jeanne Raya</li></ul><dl><dt>Republicans</dt></dl><ul><li>Vincent Barraba</li><li>Jodie Filkins Webber</li><li>Lilbert \"Gil\" R.

Board of Equalization distrcits shall be comprised of 10 Senate districts.</li></ol><p><strong><em>Ensuring Transparency</em></strong></p><p>Additionally; incumbents, candidates or political parties cannot be consulted during the district drawing process. <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_21\">Article XXI section 2(d)</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html\">California Constiution</a> also requires that the Commission \"conduct an open and transparent process enabling full public consideration and comment on the drawing of district lines.\" Taking this into consideraton, the Commission facilitated 34 hearings across the state and had 2700 citizens offer public testimony. Organizations such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Women_Voters\" title=\"League of Women Voters\">League of Women Voters</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cafwd.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">California Forward</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Cause\" title=\"Common Cause\">Common Cause</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Chamber_of_Commerce\" title=\"California Chamber of Commerce\">California Chamber of Commerce (CalChamber)</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_California\" title=\"Equality California\">Equality California</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_American_Legal_Defense_and_Educational_Fund_%28MALDEF%29\" title=\"Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF)\">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF)</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Pacific_American_Legal_Center\" title=\"Asian Pacific American Legal Center\">Asian Pacific American Legal Center</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People\" title=\"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_Leadership_Group\" title=\"Silicon Valley Leadership Group\">Silicon Valley Leadership Group</a>, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club\" title=\"Sierra Club\">Sierra Club</a> also offered testimony to the Commission. The Commission's <a href=\"http://wedrawtheline.ca.gov\">website</a> also recieved 20,000 public comments that were taken into consideration.</p><p><em><strong>Map Controversy</strong></em></p><p>Since the process was so transparent, public testimony was often partisan in nature. These citizens hoped to influence the Commission during the hearing process to ensure the new districts would be favorable to thier political affilaition. In a very controversial article investigative journalism publisher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPublica\" title=\"ProPublica\">ProPublica</a> found evidence that the <a href=\"http://www.cadem.org/\" title=\"California Democratic Party\">California Democratic Party</a> coordinated with members of the community to manipulate the process. The <a href=\"http://cagop.org\" title=\"California Republican Party\">California Republican Party</a> was quick to call for an investigation, despite the fact that many members of the media believe the <a href=\"http://cagop.org\" title=\"California Republican Party\">California Republican Party</a> to have conducted similar efforts. In response, the Commission issued a press release ensuring the public that it \"had its eyes wide open\" and \"were not unduly influenced.\"</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The <a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov\">California Citizens Redistricting Commission</a> certified its new district maps on August 15th, 2011. It was put to a vote using the \"supermajority\" that was stipulated by <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_21\">Article XXI section 2(c) and 2(g)</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html\">California Constiution</a>. Maps for the state legislature passed each with a 13-1 vote. Maps for the Congressional districts passed with a 12-2 vote.</p><h3>Legal Challenges</h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm\">California Supreme Court</a> has thrice ruled unanimously in favor of the Commission's maps, finding them in compliance with both the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html\">United States Constitution</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html\">California Constiution</a>. In response to the filing of addtional lawsuits, the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/\">United States Department of Justice</a> granted preclearance of the Commission's maps under Section 5 of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act\">Federal Voting Rights Act</a>. This streamline the map implementation and ensure that they would take effect during the June 12th, <a href=\"http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/2012-elections/june-primary/\">2012 Presidential Primary</a> even if litigation was still pending. Republican's intially disagreed with this action and subsequently put a referndum on the November 6th, 2012 ballot as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_state_elections,_November_2012#Proposition_40\">Proposition 40</a> to repeal the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate\">Senate</a> maps. The <a href=\"http://cagop.org\">California Republican Party</a> has since changed its mind and is no longer opposing the impementation of the new districts.</p><h3>Long Term Impacts</h3><p>While it can be difficult to judge the impacts of non-partisan redistricting right away, a few independent studies by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Policy_Institute_of_California\" title=\"Public Policy Institute of California\">Public Policy Institute of California</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Journal\" title=\"National Journal\">National Journal</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballotpedia\" title=\"Ballotpedia\">Ballotpedia</a> have concluded that California now has some over the most competitive districts in America. This creates a breadth of opportunities for elected officals to face their constituents and ensures that all elections are not simply coronations. As an example, between 2000 and 2010 the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_delegations_from_California\">California Congressional Delegation</a> was so safe that only one seat switched parties in 255 races. This was due to the partisan gerrymandering that was associated with redistricing after the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html\">2000 census</a>, which in turn inspired the <a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov\">California Citizens Redistricting Commission</a>.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>This referendum has no fiscal impact on the state and local governments.<a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2012/40_11_2012.aspx\">[2]</a></p><h3>Publications</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-assembly-districts.html\">Maps Final Draft: Assembly Districts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-senate-districts.html\">Maps Final Draft: Senate Districts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-congressional-districts.html\">Maps Final Draft: Congressional Districts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/maps-final-draft-board-of-equalization-districts.html\">Maps Final Draft: Board of Equalization Districts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/downloads/meeting_handouts_082011/crc_20110815_2final_report.pdf\">CRC FINAL REPORT ON 2011 REDISTRICTING</a></li></ul><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/la-redistricting-map-july-2011,0,3633335.html\">California's citizen commission final district maps: Find out what's changed where you live.</a></li><li><a href=\"http://swdb.berkeley.edu/gis/gis2011/\">Berkley District Maps GIS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Yes-on-Prop-40-for-fair-redistricting-3954742.php\">Yes on Prop 40 for fair redistricting</a></li><li><a href=\"http://spartandaily.com/86489/proposition-40-redistricting-state-senate-districs-referendum\">Proposition 40 \u2013 Redistricting, State Senate Districs, Referendum</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2083189,00.html#ixzz29gNeMIuV\">California vs. the Gerrymander: Why Republicans Are Quaking</a></li><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-new-maps-20110611,0,739110.story\" rel=\"nofollow\">District maps draw a new political landscape</a></li></ul><h3>External Links</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/\">Offical Website [wedrawthelines.ca.gov]\u00a0</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/viewer.html\">View Meetings (Video)</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/transcripts.html\">Meetings Transcripts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov/faq.html\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li></ul>", "geo_city": "Sacramento", "tags": "California Citizens Redistrciting Commission Proposition 11 Voters First Act Senate Assembly Board of Equalization", "geo_province": "California", "title_en": "California Citizens Redistricting Commission", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/california-citizens-redistricting-commission", "geo_phone": "1-866-356-5217", "geo_latitude": "38\u00b0 34' 27.0084\" N", "additional": "Suite 154-A", "author_uid": "1741", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "121\u00b0 29' 50.3124\" W", "fulltime_staff": "14", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"California-RedistrictingCommission-We-draw-The-Lines1.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2015-08-09T01:06:03", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "205-400 avenue Atlantic", "executive_director": "James McKinney", "post_date": "2012-10-11T19:15:39", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "Portugu\u00eas - Portuguese||English||Espa\u00f1ol - Spanish||Fran\u00e7ais - French||Italiano - Italian||Deutsch - German", "geo_postal_code": "H2A 1V5", "id": "654", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Place of business", "geo_country": "Canada", "content_country": "Canada", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Budgeting||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<p>Open North creates websites to promote government transparency and public participation.<br /><br /><strong>Citizen Budget</strong><br /><br />Governments use our interactive budget simulator to run online consultations that collect meaningful, considered input from residents, inform residents on costs and tradeoffs, educate residents on the budget-making process, and demonstrate commitment to citizen engagement.<br /><br /><strong>Represent API</strong><br /><br />Represent is the largest source of elected officials\u2019 contact information and electoral districts for federal, provincial and municipal governments in Canada.

They believe in complete freedoms of speech and openness, free from censorships, wire-tapping, and the inability to be anonymous. In reference to privacy laws, they hope to gain the same rights as their parents did 40 years ago (TEDxTalks). Those rights including, not being virtually monitored or tracked on the Internet and postal service. \u00a0Ultimately, they want to be able to send information or letters on the Internet or by postal with ease and comfort of privacy, because 40 years ago this sort of tracking did not exist to such an extent.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As for in the United States, The pirate movement also believes in eliminating the current welfare system and creating higher taxes but with a minimum income assurance, meaning that every person is given enough money to live off of. \u201cThis forces businesses to compete against the government and treat their employees well, as well as give them a decent wage. It also prevents any person from starving, going without healthcare, reduces violence and break-ins significantly\u201d (McCrea).</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Their message is based on the idea of politics of protest, protesting to change the status quo.\u00a0 One can compare their missions of protest similar to those like the Greens who wanted to protest pollution and Liberals who protested the royal\u2019s overbearing power control on the church. These protests and movements became established politics and policy makers all because they turned something into an ideology, similar to the Pirate Party (TEDxTalks).</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Pirate Party originated in Sweden by founder Rickard Falkvinge on January 1, 2006, originally being named \u201cPiratpartiet.\u201d \u00a0Non-supporters had giving them the name of \u2018pirates\u2019, in hopes of shaming them from the idea that they like sharing and copying (TEDxTalks).\u00a0 Falkvinge expresses that he became a politician by talking about politics in a pub and later increasing to a political leader that has parties present in over 50 countries.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Upon creating the party, Falkvinge saw three objections he had from the European Government in 2005.\u00a0 First off, there was the software patents debate in parliament that would criminalize knowledge. Secondly, there was copyright monopoly harshening in Sweden.\u00a0 And lastly, the data retention direction in Sweden, which would make all cellular phones contain tracking devices issued by the government (TEDxTalks).\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The first steps Rickard Falkvinge took to starting the Pirate Party was making a manifesto on an online chat of a mere few sentences. Within his first day, the party consisted of about 300 activists and supporters.\u00a0 At this point in the creation of the party, elections for the European Parliament of 2006 were only eight months away.\u00a0 There was increase in support and activisms within those months and they received .68% in the first election. However, due to the lack of funds, Falkvinge was forced to beg for money and donations, ultimately being chastised by non-supporters and tabloids.\u00a0 For the reelections 18 months later, the Pirate party received 7.13% votes and gained two seats in the European Parliament (TEDxTalks).\u00a0\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The official Pirate Party can be broken up into different sections depending on location and region around the World. \u00a0This allows organization and ease when planning meetings or gatherings because people and members are relatively close together.\u00a0 Pirate Party International (PPI), a non-governmental organization founded in 2010, helps to connect the party together even at such a large spectrum (PP International).\u00a0 It reinforces guidelines and communication, as well as promoting the cause, for all Pirate Parties internationally.\u00a0 The PPI bridges the gap for all Pirate Parties and can help establish new local parties in select countries. Pirate Party members are extremely diversified, coming from different backgrounds, allowing the ability for deliberation within the group possible and accessible. There are currently 29 active members from five continents that assist to the needs and run the PPI organization (PP International). Within the members, there is a board of directors who deliberate on issues regarding the organization and external issues manages the PPI.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The United States also has many local parties of pirates.\u00a0 They can be labeled as the United States Pirate National Committee (PNC) and then categorized more within states individually through membership.\u00a0 The PNC originated with the mindset of bringing the United States parties together, similar to the PPI.\u00a0 By having a centralized organization and committee, they can have collaborating and deliberation between local state parties and promote events properly.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Within the PNC, there are also different levels of membership, member and observer states. Member states have established parties with delegates who attend the National Committee meetings. Members are authorized to have complete voting privileges at deliberations and have the authority to approve new members by a majority vote. Observer States are encouraged to attend national committee meetings but do not posses the same status as member states. Observer states can eventually gain membership but must establish an organization with enough activists and members.\u00a0 (United States Pirate Party).</p><h3><strong>Participation Selection</strong></h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Participation in Pirate parties is voluntary, anyone can join. The best way to get involved is to sign up at one of the Pirate Parties websites, chat, contribute, or through social media. Some Pirate parties offer Student Internships, where students can get college credit for helping their pirate party. If you wish to ask them a question you can email them asking them about anything you like.\u00a0</p><h3><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Just like any other organization, Pirate Parties through out the world hold meetings via web chat where people can bring their ideas for the Pirate Parties forum, government crowd sourcing, platform, website, and campaigns. They have a public forum for new participants to introduce themselves to other participants. Find out about current events and get links to articles and commentary.</p><p>The meetings forum includes the months meeting agenda, and any other issues that need to be addressed. The political council forum is for extra meeting discussions on topics like civil liberties write up, privacy write up, protecting free culture, and democratic engagement. Along with other forums for decision making for standing committees, projects, parties, local events, and records/archives.\u00a0</p><h3><strong>Influence, Outcome, and Effects</strong></h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Issues they hope to tackle are copyright law. Reinforce and protect fair dealing. Decriminalize non-commercial sharing and to limit copyright to commercial use of a product. Pirate parties believe the internet is a invaluable good, and hope to resist any censorship, and regulation of the internet. Part of their belief is that they feel this is a violation of our First Amendments rights, to be protected from having their mail read, especially over the internet. They seek to reform Election and Lobbying laws, limiting the amount of power and money politicians can receive in private donations. Tackling direct democracy and participation, without the fear of repression. Supports social economic justice and the value of the little people over large corporations the 1%.</p><h3><strong>Analysis and Criticism\u00a0</strong></h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Pirate Parties have been known for their lack of solid Platform and coherence in sticking to policies. As well as admitting to having gaps in their resources, people worry they may be connected to neo-Nazi National Democratic Parties. People in Hollywood don't believe that there is anything noble about pirate parties or pirate bay, because they illegally steal copyright content and accept money for what they do.\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>McCrea, T.

Part of this focus includes work to counteract religion in politics and state affairs. To do this they must call upon all of its members to unite in a stand against the current usage of the \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019 and religion in politics.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Posting the tag line \u201cPower to the people1\u201d, this organization wants to achieve results by empowering the people of Pakistan.\u00a0 To achieve the organizations goals, this organization has established core values and principles with which its membership can align. Using these as a guide, Citizens for Democracy opposes laws and customs that discriminate on the bases of race, religion, language, ethnicity, gender, class and economic status. This group backs all measures that defend innocent people from false accusations under the \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019. Some reasons people may be falsely accused are personal reasons, dispute, rivalry and professional jealousy. This organization also encourages the use of free speech, as well as, discourse and debate surrounding free speech. They also works against extremism within Pakistan societies. They do this, because extremism can threaten individual\u2019s security and destroy state institutions that are democratic. Citizens for Democracy envisions Pakistan as a place where social justice prevails, there are equal opportunities, and the country can ensure security of individuals lives and property for their citizens. Essentially, this organization is hoping and fighting for Pakistan to live peacefully throughout all national, ethnic, religious, and other communities.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Among the goals that have already been presented, Citizens for Democracy wishes to bring the killer of Salmaan Taseer to justice, as well as, trying to guarantee that all cases of murder are treated as murder and not as religion or culture issues. They would also like to have no tolerance for violence of any kind, start the process of forming complaints against issues of hurtful speech in places of worship, and monitoring the media.</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On December 19, 2010, this organization was formed at a meeting for Karachi Press Club. This event was held by Professional Organizations Mazdoor Fedrations &amp; Hari Joint Committee (POJAC). This group is an umbrella organization with 82 member groups. Since the creating of Citizens for Democracy, it has brought in two new chapters in Lahore and Ishamabad.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Citizens for Democracy was created originally to fight against the \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019, as previously stated. The \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019 are rooted in the Indian Penal Code of 1860, specifically in, Section 295-B and 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code. This Penal Code was introduced while General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq was the leader. Section 295-B was specifically created to protect holy persons of only Islam, which is Pakistan\u2019s state religion. Most recently, Section 295-C was created by the parliament in 1986. This made it a crime to make derogatory remarks involving the Holy Prophet (PBUH). The punishment for violation these two sections could be as extreme as life in prison or death.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the more than hundred years before Section 295-C was created, there had only been fewer than ten reports of \u2018blasphemy law\u2019 cases. However, after Section 295-C was enacted in 1986, as many as 4,000 cases have been reported. Within Pakistan, authorities have charged around 650 people with offenses under the \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019. Around half of those cases charged people who were non-Muslims. From these laws, over 20 people have been sentenced to death and two thirds of the cases are in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.</p><h3>Participation Selection</h3><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 People are allowed to participate based on their own will, yet they have many calls to action on their website and in local newspapers. This organization not only wants individuals to actively participate, but also wishes to unite large groups through affiliation, as well. Citizen for Democracy provides Pakistani people with the opportunities to fight against how Pakistan\u2019s government is being run currently. Their website details a lot of ways that individuals can get involved on many different levels. On a very basic level, for example, signing up for the blog to get email notifications on new postings.\u00a0 If someone wishes to take more of an active role, members are able to repost articles and posts on to other social networking sites.\u00a0 If the desire is to fully engage with the organization, members have the option to contact the organization directly to figure out ways to become more involved on the face-to-face/local level.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This website offers a lot of information for people who are interested in learning more about the organization as well. It provides news stories and articles directly related to their core principles and values.\u00a0 This includes information on activities of individuals, group, and other organizations, notable and relevant events (past and present), and ways for individuals to voice their opinions through comments on their website and Facebook, for example. Their website also highlights the events, awareness programs, and rallies that they participate in. These events are for those who want to participate and are used to build up support for the overall goals.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The primary method that this organization uses to empower its membership and drive change is that it presents the citizens with enough information for individuals to create an informed decision about how their country is currently being run and to offer ways on their website and other social networking sites to get involved if they want to support this organization. This organization not only, allows readers to post comments on the articles posted on the website, and post the articles to other social networking sites, but it also facilitates meetings and events. The meetings are open to any individual and organizations to attend. There is an event page that announces upcoming activities in advance or provides a summary or recap of recent events. Utilizing social media, Facebook pages have also been established to help people to get informed and also share the information with others. One specific item Citizen for Democracy is taking on is filing a formal complaint against Sultan Mosque cleric Munir Ahmed Shakir for provoking people to violently act out during his Friday sermon.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Influence, Outcome, and Effects</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This organization has generated very positive results, because it has provided a way for citizens to demonstrate peacefully about their desires for democracy, tolerance, and justice. Citizen for Democracy is an alliance of many groups and individuals that all have a common desire to support the direction and influence the outcomes of this organization\u2019s involvement across the nation. These individuals and groups come together to urge repeals of the \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019, pushing an amendment of these laws, discuss these topics with expert scholars on the topics, creating events, meeting with others who feel strongly about the topic and challenging the \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019 in front of the Supreme Court. These organizations have already come together with many positive outcomes, such as, bring people together, creating events to promote awareness and creating a website for people to come to that are interested. This is, because they provide citizens with opportunities to work together in a unified stance and demonstrate peacefully about the desires surrounding the topic.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As previously stated, Citizens for Democracy is a coalition of many groups that all influence the direction and outcomes of the organization. Some of these groups include Sindh High Court Bar Association, Pakistan Medical Association, All Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation, Mutahida Labour Federation, Karachi Union of Journalists, Pakistan Workers Federation, All Pakistan Trade Union Federation, All Pakistan Clerk Association, Democratic Labour Union State Bank of Pakistan, UBL Workman Union, National Bank Trade Union Federation, Karachi Bar Association, Pakistan Nursing Federation, National Trade Union Federation, Sindh Hari Committee, Govt. Sec. Teachers Association, Pakistan Hotel and Restaurant Workers Federation, Mehran Mazdoor Federation, All Sindh Primary Teachers Association, Sindh Professor Lecturer Association, Malir Bar Association (Karachi), Pakistan Trade Union Federation, Railway Workers Union Open Line Workshop, Mehran Railway Employees Welfare Association, and All Pakistan Trade Unions Organizations.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Citizens for Democracy is a really good organization for the Pakistani citizens, because, unlike other organizations that protest violently, it provides an outlet for citizens to voice their opinions peacefully.\u00a0It provides both online and in person ways for people to get education. Online it explains exactly what they, as an organization, the changes they are working to support, and provides many articles to read to stay up to date about what is going on. Though there are many of these articles on their website, they do not add them frequently. There has only been one new article posted in the last month.\u00a0 Unfortunately, lack of current content can also adversely affect membership involvement, because there is less need to check the web site on a frequent basis.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although this is a very good organization, it supports values and principles that are ofter controversial in Pakistan, so it faces challenges and also has its critics. One comment by Ali Kazmi is that people are lazy and that getting many people to fight against the \u2018blasphemy laws\u2019 and come up with their own ideas will be difficult. Right now they have many good ideas, but these ideas have been hand fed to them and he believes that this organization may not see follow through. Another critic he has of Citizens for Democracy is what he calls \u201cperceived external enemies\u201d. Pakistan citizens have a large focus on people, such as United States citizens, as being enemies without specific reason or example. This can hurt the organization, as well, because it supports extremist view points.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ema Anis has also criticized Citizens for Democracy. She said that she went to one of the groups events to see how this new organization worked and what she saw didn\u2019t make her feel like there was going to create change. She saw people coming in at their leisure to sign a petition that was sent to Pakistan governing officials about wanting to move away from extremist view points. Though she believes this is a nice idea, she doesn\u2019t believe it has the power to create change.

Thus, their goal is to change the way we deliberate by emphasizing the need for important values and objectives within such conversations. This is achieved through an internet-mediated platform meant for respectful and credible deliberation. The DemocracyLab website fosters this type of environment through allowing participants to rank different values, objectives, and policies of a certain topic.\u00a0<br class=\"kix-line-break\" /><br class=\"kix-line-break\" />DemocracyLab users are encouraged to delve into the values behind an issue in order to understand and respect others\u2019 thought processes behind proposed solutions. This idea of value-based decisions has been a unique aspect of DemocracyLab, which separates\u00a0it from other online deliberation platforms. Using emotions and opinionated remarks can lead to confusion between those deliberating. Instead, values allow people to have a common ground of understanding as the foundation for their deliberation.\u00a0<br class=\"kix-line-break\" /><br class=\"kix-line-break\" />DemocracyLab also believes that technology has an extensive influence on making large-scale decisions. As the world of technology expands, more people are able to take part in online deliberation. \u00a0DemocracyLab is dependent on the participation, knowledge, and opinions of citizens in order to bring everyone closer to the ideal democracy that America needs.</p><h2>History</h2><p>DemocracyLab was founded by Mark Frischmuth in July 2006. Frischmuth became interested in political deliberation after the 2004 Presidential Election, when George W. Bush was chosen to serve for a second term. Regarding the results, the media stated that \u201cAmerica voted on its values.\u201d However, this statement did not resonate with Frischmuth, his friends, or his family. That election opened his eyes to a disconnect which existed between the values of the American people and those of the policies being implemented. This revelation was unsettling for him, and he was determined to make a change.<br class=\"kix-line-break\" /><br class=\"kix-line-break\" />Frischmuth then began to take steps toward creating a platform for value-based deliberation. He first sought wisdom and insight from family and friends, who encouraged him to pursue this end. So he applied for the 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and began to network and interview for the Board of Directors. Once approved, he created the DemocracyLab website. Once the organization started to gain momentum, Frischmuth sought out many respected people for feedback. One specific person who influenced Frischmuth was the founder of <a href=\"http://americaspeaks.org/\">AmericaSpeaks</a>, Carolyn J. Lukensmeyer. She gave Frischmuth insight regarding how to further develop his\u00a0organization.</p><p>A pilot project for DemocracyLab was then launched at the University of Portland, where students used the forum to facilitate deliberation and find a solution to relevant issues at the campus. This project allowed Frischmuth to see the website in action and revealed some shortcomings of the organization. As a means to act on these shortcomings, Claire Adamsick, the Communications Director of DemocracyLab, attended the\u00a0<a href=\"http://ncdd.org/\">National Coalition of Dialogue and Deliberation</a>(NCDD) in order to gain further insight on how to develop DemocracyLab and expand political deliberation amongst the country. As the organization continues to drive forward, more tests will be done to see how the website has improved and regressed.</p><p>There is still much room for DemocracyLab to grow into a fully-functional online platform for political deliberation. The current focus of the organization is on team building and developing the website. However, as DemocracyLab continues to grow, the hope is that this will shift to improving the means in which value-based decisions are made.</p><h2>Open Source Software</h2><p>DemocracyLab was founded using\u00a0<a href=\"http://opensource.org/\">Open Source Software</a>, which is essentially free software that prevents nonprofit organizations from paying a hefty price for their fully operative websites. The users of the software are able to improve and edit the software by adding the appropriate code for the errors that they find within the program. Thus, every time the software is downloaded, it will ideally be updated and improved by various users to make it just as fast and reliable as other expensive software.</p><p>DemocracyLab has used Open Source Software as a means to build their website. Since it is a nonprofit organization, this reliable and free software has opened the doors to improve online deliberation and make the website easy to use for those who are engaged in the platform. This software has helped DemocracyLab become closer to creating a place where citizens, politicians, and leaders can use the site to make informed decisions that are representative of citizens' values.</p><p>Open Source Software is devoted to the creation of user-generated content and the ability to obtain it without cost. A primary value of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://opensource.org/about\">Open Source Software Initiative</a>\u00a0is free redistribution, and fights to make web use and software affordable. They also do not tolerate discrimination, and allow people of every age, color, and organization to access it.</p><h2>Participants\u00a0</h2><p>Anyone is able to participate on the DemocracyLab online engagement platform, as long as they are connected to some kind of social media. Users can only access the forum by logging into their Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin accounts. However, DemocracyLab stressed that they will not post anything on those social media sites without the permission of the user.</p><p>DemocracyLab can be found on\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/democracylab\">Twitter</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/DemocracyLab/11842793001?sk=info\">Facebook</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/DemocracyLab/\">Meetup.com</a>. These sites update followers on where they are hosting in-person events and on what issues are currently being deliberated. There are approximately 1,000 followers on Twitter, but this number continues to grow as new members join the movement toward better deliberation.</p><p>In order to participate in DemocracyLab, concerned citizens can go on to their website, democracylab.org, and click on the link \u201cGet Involved.\u201d Once on that page, the website lists the various ways to get involved. Citizens can donate money, follow DemocacyLab on Twitter, like them on Facebook, or contact the creators directly. DemocracyLab does not necessarily recruit participants, but instead gives everyone the opportunity to voice their opinions in a civil and respectful manner. </p><h2>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interactions\u00a0</h2><p>DemocracyLab encourages deliberation through providing an online platform where one can choose their most prevalent values, objectives, and policies of an issue, in order to arrive at a credible solution. They use a system of ranking in order to allow participants to identify the root values of an issue instead of allowing party biases to distort them. This form of deliberation is open to everyone who has access to social media.\u00a0</p><p>There is no means to come to a consensus while using DemocracyLab. The online platform is solely used to discuss issues with other concerned citizens in the community. The ability to know others\u2019 opinions will hopefully encourage politicians and those in power to use DemocracyLab as a way to make sounds decisions. <br /><br class=\"kix-line-break\" />When one enters DemocracyLab\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/\">online engagement platform</a>, they are able to choose from a series of different issues to deliberate upon. Next, they are brought to a screen with pre-selected values that are representative of the problem at hand. The users can drag and drop different values into categories entitled: \u201cof most importance,\u201d \u201cof least importance,\u201d or \u201cno opinion.\u201d Once the values are classified, users can then rate their objectives and policies in the same manner. This system of ranking allows participants to state their opinions, but prevents the distortion of political party biases and strong emotional attachments from slipping in. In addition, participants are able to see what others had ranked as their most important values, objectives, and policies to help improve their analytic rigor.</p><h2>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects\u00a0</h2><p>DemocracyLab\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a more deliberative and democratic society through improving deliberation on social media platforms. They have made large strides towards this goal through their technological impact on the way people think and make decisions for their community. They have been influenced greatly by several political deliberation groups such as:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.americaspeaks.org/\">AmericaSpeaks</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.delib.net/\">Delib</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/index.aspx\">Everyday Democracy</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://healthydemocracy.org/\">Healthy Democracy Fund</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.metagovernment.org/\">Metagovernment.org</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://ncdd.org/\">National Coalition of Dialogue and Deliberation</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://participatedb.com/\">Participate DB</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.policyconsensus.org/\">Policy Census Initiative</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahindi</a>. DemocracyLab has implemented some of the themes and values of these groups as a premise for political deliberation. The organization is still in its beginning stages, so the effects are not apparent yet. However, DemocracyLab has the potential to facilitate some of the most imperative political deliberations on the internet.</p><h2>Analysis and Criticism\u00a0</h2><p>Despite the well-thought-out goals and ideas of DemocracyLab, some criticisms by its users have also come to light. One critique of the organization is that participants can only gain access to the platform through social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin. This means that concerned citizens who do not use social media sites cannot participate in deliberation via DemocracyLab. Although social media could potentially promote participation (i.e. seeing \u201cfriends\u201d using the site), it could also deter participants who prefer to be more private. DemocracyLab stresses that no information will be posted without your consent, but users may still be wary of connecting their political engagements to their mediated social life.<br class=\"kix-line-break\" /><br class=\"kix-line-break\" />Also, it would be beneficial to have more clarification on how to use the website. \u00a0The \u201cdrag-and-drop\u201d system of the values, objectives, and policies may be confusing for some users. More so, it constrains participants to only a few options. Many users of online deliberation platforms want to voice their opinions instead of being forced to choose from a list.\u00a0<br class=\"kix-line-break\" /><br class=\"kix-line-break\" />Despite these shortcomings, DemocracyLab seizes the opportunity for a diversity of voices to make sound decisions based through the ranking of values, objectives, and policies. It also fosters a respectful environment by preventing participants from posting vulgar content which is detrimental to political deliberation. Once DemocracyLab has further developed, it could be an ideal way for the community to be engaged in politics and make sound decisions regarding the future of their community and their country.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Adamsick, Claire .

Americans Elect has focused on achieving three clear goals:</p><ul><li>Gaining nationwide ballot access for a third presidential ticket to compete in the 2012 race;</li><li>Holding the first ever nonpartisan secure national online primary at AmericansElect.org;</li><li>Fielding a credible, balanced, unaffiliated ticket for the 2012 presidential race.</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p><u>Purpose</u>: To offer more viable third party options to the American public.</p><p>The founders all felt that the status quo is broken; they are exasperated with partisan politics. They wanted a new solution and they felt like a radically new approach would reset the political scene. Two of their core ideas - the importance of a centrist, bi-partisan approach to the solving of our nation's problems and the possibility of an independent, unity ticket for the presidency.\u00a0</p><p><u>Problems</u>: One of the many problems with Americans Elect is exposure.</p><p>The reason that the organization suspended itself until 2013 was they weren\u2019t able to get enough American political interest in the general population for their vision. This same lack of interest eventually made them unable to champion a candidate to go on the ballot and declared \u201cno candidate had reached the required level of national support to qualify for Americans Elect's online convention.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody had come close to meeting the minimal threshold of 10,000 votes to win the Americans Elect online primary.\u00a0</p><p>Partisanship was a serious problem with the movement. Not too long after they dropped their plans to offer a third party candidate for the 2008 presidential election, they told the press that they would focus on other campaign issues. They then targeted some of their funding towards partisan advertisements in the years leading up to 2012, such as encouragement for the Simpson-Bowles commission to control deficit spending.\u00a0</p><p>The group has met with skepticism within the Washington beltway because there has been a backlash of criticism based on the traditional third party argument; people see this as another way to take away disproportional votes from one of the two main parties which could create a counterproductive scenario. \u00a0The group, Americans Elect, failed to generate interest in possible campaigns from Sens. Joe Lieberman and Lamar Alexander, and its intensive outreach to a host of other prospective candidates, including former Nebraska Sens. Chuck Hagel and Bob Kerrey, didn\u2019t yield much political \u201cbuzz\u201d for its efforts.\u00a0</p><p>Buddy Roemer, former Democratic governor from Louisiana and former Republican presidential candidate, who on a prime facie basis, fulfilled the politically expansive profile Americans Elect was seeking, topped the list of \"declared candidates.\"\u00a0He had 4,354 on-line support clicks, placing him squarely in the lead of this race, but he failed\u00a0to qualify for the Americans Elect candidacy before the group withdrew from the 2012 campaign. It was common conjecture that Americans Elect leadership determined that Governor Roemer\u2019s pedigree and maverick positions (e.g. legalized gambling) did not fit neatly into the worldviews of the organization's donors.\u00a0</p><p>The most successful candidate on the \"draft\" side, was Ron Paul, who came the closest to the mark with 9,330 \"support clicks\u201d. Ron Paul was considered a political outlier, whose nomination would undoubtedly never have cleared American Elect\u2019s nine-member board of directors, which Phil Ackerman put together and bestowed $5 Million in seed money.\u00a0 The directors retain the right to vet and even veto the candidates to spare the organization embarrassment and even mutiny.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The history of Americans Elect begins with Unity08, a political movement that attempted to reform the political system by giving voters a viable nonpartisan \u201cthird party option in the 2008 presidential elections.\" The group was created by political figures, Doug Bailey, former President Carter Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, and Gerald Rafshoon, and was made up of Democrats and Republicans who wanted to see a change in the status quo, transitioning away from highly polarized leadership and towards a future where Americans had more power to affect the political system.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Unity08 fizzled out with time after the founders, Doug and Rafshoon, quit the team to \u201cdraft Mr. Bloomberg\u201d as a potential candidate for President as an alternative to the 2008 election calculus.</p><p>Peter Ackerman and Kahlil Byrd established Americans Elect in 2010 as a continuation of Unity08. The goal of Americans Elect was to create the first \u201cnonpartisan, national online presidential primary.\" They refined the \u201cField of Dreams \u2013 Build It and They Will Come\u201d strategy to be different from the Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, John Anderson, and Theodore Roosevelt third-party models where the candidate came first, and the money and organization followed. What Americans Elect was trying to do was the reverse.\u00a0 Ackerman and Bird were out to build an organization and handle the tedious task of getting the party on the ballot in every state, all in hopes of enticing an \u201cA\u201d List candidate.\u00a0</p><p>Many were optimistic 2012 was the year because there was general unhappiness in the electorate over Congress and the legislature\u2019s gridlock and lack of accomplishment.\u00a0 To not drum up enthusiasm for a third-party in a year like this when neither candidate was prohibitively popular, was almost resignation that a third-party renaissance in American politics will continue to be put off.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p><u>Delegates:</u></p><p>Every American citizen committed to improving the political process at the Federal government can join the process. \u00a0Americans Elect delegates can be any registered voter who signs up online to choose a presidential ticket through successive rounds of Internet voting. Americans Elect\u2019s open membership policies garnered just shy of eligible delegates to be included in the selection process.\u00a0</p><p><u>Candidates:</u></p><p>Much of the attraction associated with becoming a delegate is that delegates and not party leaders have full control of who is drafted as a candidate. Their criterion for possible presidential selection included proverbial qualifications such as being a United States Senator, a president of an organization with a large member base, a ranked military officer, Governors, Cabinet portfolios, etc. Such lofty credentials qualifications were not necessary in the end because all constitutionally eligible United States citizens are permitted to run for President of the United States.\u00a0</p><p><u>Nominee:</u></p><p>In order to qualify for the primary ballot, a single candidate with the qualifications listed above needed only 10,000 support clicks from ten different states. The initial phase of voting was intended to weed the competition down to six contenders. \u00a0If any ticket received a majority they would immediately become the nominee. Without that being the case, the top two individuals who received the most votes would face off in another round of voting to determine the nominee.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interactions</h3><p>This group received substantial media coverage during the beginning of their organization. It slowly tapered off as time went on and a candidate didn\u2019t emerge.\u00a0Political movements are typically built around compelling personalities or causes, but not technology, and neither personality or causes materialized for Americans Elect.\u00a0Despite widespread discontent with the two-party system and near-record numbers of people saying that they would be open to voting for a third-party candidate, the future of another major political party emerging after the failure of Americans Elect to field a viable candidate in 2012 appears impractical.\u00a0</p><p>The perception in many politico circles is this was a dubious end for a group that carried a number of high-profile backers in the political strategist and donor community\u00a0and who, as of earlier this month, had secured ballot access in more than half of the 50 states. Elections in a Republic like the United States are winner take all with the Electoral College, so there will be a clear victor elected, without all the coalition-building that comes with a parliamentary system. Like any other secular industry selling homogenous goods or services with a high barrier to entry like commercial aircraft, high-speed mainframe computers and political parties, usually duopolies emerge, e.g. Boeing vs. Airbus, Cray vs. IBM, Republicans versus Democrats.\u00a0 The only dynamic that might not force voters into two camps may be non-secular in origin, which is something Unity08 wanted to avoid at all costs.\u00a0</p><p>There are lots of small \u201cthird parties\u201d out there, but they rarely win major elections. The few political \u201cindependents\u201d in Congress, like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, are people who get elected not because of some structure someone else set up, but through their own political skill. And they end up caucusing with one party or the other anyway, as Senator Sanders caucuses\u00a0with the Democrats.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>There hadn\u2019t been a credible third-party candidate since 1992 when Texas businessman, Ross Perot, garnered an impressive 19% of the popular vote and created a novel dynamic and uncertainty among the pundits in the race between President George Herbert Bush and Governor Bill Clinton.\u00a0 Ross Perot also ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1996, but his backing had dwindled to only 9% of the electorate.\u00a0</p><p>The defection of Bailey and Rafshoon supplanted Unity08 of much its mainstream support on behalf of a third-party strategy largely because the notion of \u201cDraft Blomberg\u201d was met initially with a fair amount of enthusiasm. However, a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University<a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/poll-some-would-draft-bloomberg-for-governor/\">\u00a0</a>found that 61 percent of New Yorkers thought Mr. Bloomberg had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to serve out his full term, and Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s reluctance to seize the possibility were catalysts in their \u201ccause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\u201d to dissipate almost as fast as it was proposed.\u00a0</p><p>Americans Elect tried to immediately distinguish themselves from the fractionalized 2008 Bloomberg courtship.\u00a0 Right out of the gate, within its first few hours of business to select a nominee through a 2012 online primary, Americans Elect\u2019s 360,000 delegates drafted 52 candidates for president, including well-recognized politicians such as Michael Bloomberg, Jon Huntsman, Buddy Roemer, Warren Buffett, Rahm Emanuel and Condoleezza Rice. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What frustrated follow-on actions from advancing this impressive list was the manifest complexity of the process.\u00a0 The delegates could anticipate beginning three rounds of online voting to narrow the field to six candidates. \u00a0The ultimate winner would be selected in June as the Americans Elect nominee and will appear on the ballot in November.\u00a0 Their running mate would have to be a past member of the opposing political party of the nominee.\u00a0 For instance, if George Stephanopoulos, a former Democrat, was the nominee, a Republican like Condoleezza Rice would be slotted as the vice-presidential candidate. That many conflicting ideologies on the same ticket projected a risky partnership; the actual task of governing for leaders who were political incompatible would result in something as dysfunctional as the Democratic or Republicans parties may do on their own. \u00a0</p><p>The result was a hardening of conventional wisdom that a third-party movement will not take much more than a pox-on-both-your-parties sentiment or a single-issue crusade for the effort to succeed. It will also require a compelling candidate and a convincing, comprehensive platform. And it will require money \u2014 perhaps several hundred million dollars \u2014 to compete with the financial power of the major parties. \u201cThis is a very, very major organizational undertaking,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s like building an army from scratch. And how you do that without significant resources \u2014 organizational resources, monetary resources, intellectual resources.\u201d Unfortunately, in era of 30-second \u201csound bites,\u201d over-complication contributed to failing to generate enough interest in the concept. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>At first Unity08 was a \u201cmedia darling\u201d story because their premise was so simplistic and its simplicity made the idea plausible.\u00a0 A group of political consultants, both Democratic and Republican, proposed a presidential ticket comprise of one candidate from each side of the partisan divide. The founders of Unity08 believed their best chance for momentum was to mine support from the prevalent dissatisfaction from the public\u2019s view that neither the Democratic nor the Republican leaders are doing enough to put the country in the right direction.</p><p>Unity08 said it could win by stressing an outsider\u2019s commitment to tackling problems the parties haven\u2019t solved \u2014 partly because of the long run of divided government but also, the outsiders say, because both parties are motivated to emphasize partisanship in the cause of self-preservation. \u201cGood and qualified people see politics as so poisonous today that they simply don\u2019t want to participate,\u201d explained Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and a major player in the Americans Elect movement. \u201cIt\u2019s just damn difficult to break the iron grip of the two-party system.</p><p>The irony about Americans Elect to date is the view the only way to repair the perception of flawed democracy involves secret money. There also arises a serious question as to whether an organization whose stated aim is to participate in the presidential election \u2014 and has qualified <em>as a political party</em> on state ballots \u2014 can claim it is a nonprofit organization not required to disclose donors. Americans Elect argues that secrecy is necessary because its underwriters fear retaliation for challenging the political status quo. Its eventual nominee will comply with ordinary rules requiring disclosure and limiting contributions.</p><p>The one tangibly positive upshot of Americans Elect, is that it propelled one of its founders, Angus King, into the victor\u2019s circle as the newest Senator from Maine.\u00a0 Angus King has served earlier as an independent Governor of Maine.\u00a0 True to his conviction, Senator-elect King ran as an independent candidate and earned more votes from registered Democrats than the official Democratic nominee.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0Vogel, Kenneth P. and Abby Phillip, \u201cAmericans Elect 2012 presidential run: The\u00a0third-party group has cash, but no candidate,\u201d\u00a0<u>Politico</u>, 13 January 2012, 21 October\u00a02012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71399.html&gt;\">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71399.html&gt;</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <u>Unity -08: The Re-United States of America</u>, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.unity08.com/&gt;\">http://www.unity08.com/&gt;</a>.</p><p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <u>Americans Elect: Pick a President, Not a Party</u>, &lt;AmericansElect.org&gt;.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>4.\u00a0Bailey, Doug, \u2018\u201dUnity \u201808\u201d Seeks Third Party,\u201d <u>The Washington Post</u>, 27 June 2006,\u00a021 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/15/DI2006061501406.html&gt;\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/15/DI200...</a>.</p><p>5.\u00a0Chan, Sewell, \u201dTime for the Mayor to Make Up His Mind,\u201d <u>The New York Times</u>, 11 January 2008, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/\">http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/</a> time-for-the-mayor-to-make-up-his-mind/.</p><p>6.\u00a0Giroux, Greg, \u201cFrom CQ Weekly: Third-Party Push by Unity \u201908 a Matter of Hope vs. History, <u>The New York Times</u>, 7 May 2007, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/05/07/cq_2681.html?pagewanted=print&gt;\">http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/05/07/cq_2681.html?pagewanted=print&gt;</a>.</p><p>7.\u00a0Cilliza, Chris and Aaron Blake, \u201cAmericans Elect and the death of the third party movement,\u201d <u>The Washington Post</u>, 18 May 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/americans-elect-and-the-death-of-the-third-party-movement/2012/05/17/gIQAIzNKXU_blog.html&gt;\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/americans-elect-and-the...</a>.</p><p>8.\u00a0Linkens, Jason, \u201cLate Returns: Americans Elicet Candidates Still Not Doing Well,\u201d <u>Huffington Post</u>, 2 May 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/</a> 2012/05/02/late-returns-candidates-not-doing-well_n_1472654.html&gt;.</p><p>9.\u00a0Linkins, Jason, \u201cAmericans Elect?\u00a0 More Like American\u2019t Elect,\u201d <u>Huffington Post</u>,15 May 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/\u00a0\u00a0\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/\u00a0\u00a0</a> americans-elect-candidate-deadline_n_518060.html&gt;.</p><p>10.\u00a0Meyerson, Harold, \u201cDon\u2019t let Americans Elect muddy the 2012 race,\u201d <u>The Los Angeles Times</u>, 20 March 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/\">http://articles.latimes.com/2012/</a> mar/20/opinion/la-oe-meyerson-americans-elect-20120320&gt;.</p><p>11.\u00a0Marcus, Ruth, \u201cAmericans Elect: A wild card for the Internet age,\u201d <u>The Washington Post</u>, 27 December 2011, 21 October 2012,&lt;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americans-elect-a-wild-card-for-the-internet-age/2011/12/27/gIQAPYlILP_story.html&gt;\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americans-elect-a-wild-card-for-t...</a>.</p><p>12.\u00a0Douthat, Ross, \u201cThe Third Party Fantasy,\u201d <u>The New York Times</u>, 15 May 2012, 21October 2012,&lt;

The HRCCE designs and implements a deliberative forum in which their citizens can actively and efficiently collaborate with their government. The HRCCE motivate its citizens to be involved in their regions future issues and the Center\u2019s goal is to make sure their public agencies are responsible and clear on issues. The HRCCE is a unbiased source where facts stand strong on even some of the most difficult regional issues. The center reaches out to the public so everyone has a chance to understand the issues that the region is dealing with and brings in the public voice that has long been over-looked.</p>\n<p>Problems and Purpose<br />\nThe HRCEE center plans to make big steps towards obtaining a more deliberative democracy in their region. Problems in today\u2019s deliberation arise from public opinions not being heard and big companies and organizations usually running the show. The main problem is that the public depends on their government to follow through with decisions and implement them, and more than a few times, the public has been left frustrated and angry. The American belief is that public deliberation is directly tied with the government and that is not happening anymore. Too many times has the public felt like they are not a priority when it comes to the government making decisions and society demands access to the government through participation options. In partnership and combined ventures with the region\u2019s public and private universities and local governments, the Center intends to expand a sturdy civic commitment program of research and practice customized to the southeastern Virginia region, structuring the region\u2019s own lasting ability for civic enhancement.</p>\n<p>HRCCE will provide an institutional resource within southeastern Virginia which public agencies may access either to help in designing participation plans an agency will conduct, or, as direct implementer of a participation program using small or large group facilitation processes and practical information skill.</p>\n<p>There are three main aspects to HRCCE\u2019s pathway;</p>\n<p>First, the inclusion of citizens in the public choices related to their region\u2019s quality of life and future improves the quality and sustainability of public decisions and supports responsibility and clearness.</p>\n<p>And second, that citizens have both rights and duties to participate in the shaping of their community and all public decision making will be improved by the knowledgeable commitment of citizens.</p>\n<p>Lastly, these prospective enhancements come from changes that occur over time. This is a new advance to public decision making and it requires a change in the relationship between citizens and government. The new advances come about due to our world changing. Deliberation is not what is used to be in our founding fathers\u2019 times, there is so much change that has happened since. New technologies, new ways to communicate (i.e. the internet, email, blogs, twitter, etc.,) new issues, new media, basically a lot has changed. That change will come with new experiences and new admiration for the power of community teamwork.</p>\n<p>History<br />\nThe origin of the Hampton Roads Center for Civic Engagement was an initiative intended and managed by Jim Babcock and the regional group - Future of Hampton Roads. The initiative had a main goal to basically strive for opportunities that would make the Hampton Roads region more willing to efficiently make the region connected and more willing to deliberate. Regions can be regarded as \u201ceconomic engines\u201d of the future so this initiative was to make sure that the future of Hampton Roads was going in the right direction and therefore the HRCCE was born. </p>\n<p>The future of Hampton Roads, Inc. was founded in 1982 by a select few of Hampton Roads community leaders with a promise to improve the present and future quality of life for citizens of Hampton Roads. As a non-partisan and non-profit organization, the Future of Hampton Roads, Inc. depends mostly on individuals and businesses ready to support it financially and accepts no funds from political subdivisions.</p>\n<p>Participant Selection<br />\nAnyone can participate in this organization, who actively wants to participate in diversifying deliberation. Whether you are a resident of Virginia, or a resident from another state, you may participate. Hampton Roads Center for Civic Engagement has many events outside of the state of Virginia and many online forums to participate. You can even participate through writing directly to them. The main resources and the most promotion will take place in Virginia because the main motive is directed towards the area of Hamptons Roads and their local and surrounding residents.</p>\n<p>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction<br />\nThe HRCCE looks out to different programs and agencies to provide opportunities for the public to promote and maintain more deliberative interactions between the public and the government. Programs like Deliberative Polling\u00a9, AmericaSpeaks\u00a9, Citizen Jury\u00a9, and Study Circles\u00a91 and many others, have already been used by regions around the U.S. and even internationally. These programs do a great job of pin-pointing specific issues that are of legitimate public concern. The HRCCE\u2019s plan is to bring these effective programs to the Hampton Roads region, while specifically customizing their function to the region\u2019s public makeup which consists of 16 independent cities and counties, and to southeastern Virginia\u2019s social and economic environment. HRCCE will supply an institutional source within southeastern Virginia which public agencies can access to assist in coming up with participation plans for an agency to conduct. By doing all this, the HRCCE plans to implement all these various resources and programs to achieve their end final goal of having a civil public population that knows how to deliberate based on many different factors like knowledge, interaction, respect, critical thinking, analyzing, reasoning, and understanding. The HRCCE is generating much help from these various programs to ensure that their citizens from Virginia and many surrounding cities have the chance and ability to learn in a way where public deliberation will be done in a way where it is the most efficient method.</p>\n<p>The HRCCE makes sure it also works with other organizations to achieve the highest level of deliberation. In May of 2011, the HRCCE was invited to join the Kettering Foundation\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d of Centers for Civic Life. This invite resulted due to the HRCCE\u2019s hard work to make sure their citizens are a part of public problem solving. This invitation consists of the HRCCE entering a \u201cjoint learning relationship\u201d with the Kettering Foundation and also other Centers for Civic Life. What this means is that all these centers will be working together on various issues as research for problem solving and answering the Kettering Foundation\u2019s two main questions: \u201cWhat does it take for democracy to work as it should?\u201d and \u201cWhat does it take for citizens to shape their collective future?\u201d as stated by the Kettering Foundation. One example of a active issue that the HRCCE Board is working on is the high school dropout rates. The different kinds of participant involvement that the HRCCE is using consist of conducting interviews and also encouraging the public to discuss in online surveys that are posted on the organization\u2019s website. </p>\n<p>The HRCCE is very active in making sure they utilize public-decision making by partnering with various different organizations. The HRCCE has also partnered up with the City of Virginia Beach to include citizens that want to make a change to the city\u2019s future of transportation. Citizens of Hampton Roads and city officials have agreed with the HRCCE that they would like to see \u201cEnvision Transportation,\u201d which is a community conversation on transportation choices in Virginia Beach, to grow into an endeavor to bring the local government closer to the citizens to continue to achieve public-made decisions. The citizens agree with the local government to analyze possibilities together when it comes to the future of transportation for Virginia Beach. </p>\n<p>Influence, Outcome, and Effects<br />\nThe HRCCE is so people have a safe neutral place where everyone feels invited to the table. The HRCCE encourages, supports, and sustains activities and organizations that promote regionalism, and pursues the vision of a political union representing the region. Basically HRCCE\u2019s main goal is to bring back a form of deliberation that has been lost through the years due to corruptness and just not bringing attention to the issue. The end effect that the HRCCE hopes to achieve is to have a system of deliberation that will provide the most richest reasoning and thinking when it comes to arguing about and agreeing on certain decisions. Just being able to deliberative with one another in a manner that is respectful and profession will automatically yield the best results. </p>\n<p>Analysis and Criticism<br />\nThe HRCCE hopes to create opportunities for everyone\u2019s voice and opinions to be heard in Hampton Roads. Their main goal is to make sure they create a deliberative democracy and help their community make knowledgeable decisions with communal dialogue. </p>\n<p>Even though the HRCCE creates the perfect atmosphere for respectful diverse deliberation, there are still problems that can arise. If there is a majority of one group in a certain communicative hall, the minority will feel overpowered and also this is going to have a little bit of bias because it is based in Virginia. Views and opinions will always be different according to what state you are residing in. The only problem here that can be a huge factor is the region. If this HRCCE organization primarily focuses on residents specially in Hampton Roads, how will those residents even see the different opinions and views from surrounding states and even further to the coasts? Hopefully the HRCCE will really take into consideration the surrounding regions\u2019 ideas and thoughts into implementing their deliberation motives and methods. </p>\n<p>Secondary Sources<br />\n\u2022\tHR Partnership. \u201cHampton Roads Center for Civic Engagement\u2019s first e-Newsletter.\u201d Smartregion.org.

Their mission is to, \u201cfoster infrastructure, habits, and capacities for more effective civic engagement and innovative decision making.\u201d They believe that communities have the ability to address their own concerns by bringing together unique voices in lateral meeting formats to decide what they can do together, as opposed to asking authority figures to intervene and solve problems for them (McKenzie,\u201cRebuilding Our Community: What Should We do?\u201d).The focus of their educational workshops is to improve communities\u2019 ability to convene, work together to make creative decisions, and learn from the interactive experiences of forums and workshops.</p><p>In addition to educating the public on the deliberat\u00ad\u00adive process, the David Mathews Center also wants to foster democracy by bringing Alabama citizens together for deliberative conversations and helping them take action on an issue of community concern. These deliberative conversations focus on a range of important issues and allow for citizens to consider a number of solutions alongside their potential consequences, and then reach a working group decision.</p><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>In the 1990s, The Center was founded originally as the Alabama Institute for Community Leadership and Development. This institute hosted annual workshops to teach communities the skills necessary for deliberative discussion. These workshops based their structure on resources developed by the National Issues Forums.</p><p>The Institute became the Alabama Center for Civic Life in the early 2000s. The Center became a 501 (c)(3) and expanded their mission to working with communities on national issues in conjunction with local issues.</p><p>The Center was renamed to honor David Mathews in 2008. David Mathews served as the secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare during the Ford administration during which he worked on restoring public confidence in government and reforming the regulatory system (\u201cDavid Mathews\u201d). David Mathews is a former President of the University of Alabama and is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of the Charles F. Kettering Foundation in Dayton, Ohio(\u201cAbout Us\u201d).</p><h3><strong>Signature programs</strong></h3><p>The David Mathews Center for Civic Life wants the public to participate in and be educated about their role in democracy and how they can improve their ability to make creative decisions. The Center\u2019s signature programs are the Alabama Issues Forums (AIF), the Coaching Community Innovation Workshops (CCI), the Teacher\u2019s Institute, Citizen\u2019s Congress, the Jean O\u2019Conner-Synder Internship Program, and their joint learning programs with The American Village.</p><p><u><strong>Alabama Issues Forums (AIF):</strong></u></p><p>The Alabama Issues Forums (AIF) bring Alabama citizens together in deliberative discussion to prioritize their issues of concern and then reach attainable solutions that can be maintained. These discussions discourage the divisions created by debate and encourage \u201cactively listen[ing] and think[ing] through real solutions to issues, while also considering the trade-offs and consequences associated with the actions discussed.\u201d (\u201cSignature Programs: Alabama Issues Forums\u201d). The AIF is based on the belief that, \u201cordinary citizens can and do make a significant impact on the issues that concern them and that opportunities for deliberative decision-making strengthens their work\u201d (McCauley et al. \u201c2009-2010 Alabama Issues Forum Report\u201d).</p><p>AIF uses National Issues Forums (NIF) materials and issue maps created by The Center to foster deliberative experiences. The issue maps are created for the participants to use as a reference for how to talk about the issue they are discussing. These provide a framework for \u201ccareful weighing of attractions, bothersome aspects, costs, consequences, and trade offs among different courses of action\u201d(\u201cSignature Programs: Alabama Issues Forums\u201d). The maps provide important background information and three possible solutions, each with pro and con arguments. These issue maps allow for participants to see alternative perspectives prior to the deliberation taking place (McKenzie et al.\u201cDropouts: What Should We Do?\u201d). After the forum has been completed,The Mathews Center then provides annual reports to the public describing the information that they gathered from the AIF that reflect how citizens are thinking about issues in the areas of \u201ccitizen responsibilities, education, economic development, and public health\u201d(\u201cSignature Programs: Alabama Issues Forums\u201d).This information is gathered through post-deliberation reflections and questionnaires completed by the participants.</p><p>The 2009-2010 AIF used the NIF issue book entitled, \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Challenge: Reclaiming the Public\u2019s Role,\u201d to discuss why citizens are not participating in public life or engaging in their communities as much as they have in the past 50 years. They addressed these issues of concern in 21 communities across Alabama with over 400 citizens.</p><p>The 2010-2011 AIF, \u201cOur Community, Our Future: The Role of Citizens in Solving the High School Dropout Situation,\u201d was decided upon by the people of Alabama when asked what community issues concerned them. Approximately 1,000 citizens in 30 counties participated in 40 forums to deliberate the dropout situation in Alabama. The issue was further explored through a Citizen\u2019s Congress in June of 2010 to develop an issue map for the AIF, \u201cDropouts: What Should We Do?\u201d . The center provided neutral moderators and recorders for every forum and each deliberation was carefully recorded. Seven major themes developed out of the 40 deliberations which revealed \u201ca statewide dialogue with cross demographic agreement\u201d on numerous important aspects of the dropout issue. After the deliberations, communities committed to take action through projects or initiatives to help solve the issue.The Center aims to encourage and increase civic engagement by acting as a forum for the community to gather, come up with a creative and tangible solution and take collective action. They want participants to move from the deliberation in to securing commitments to act on their solution, one of the seven democratic processes that the Center utilizes and believes in(McCauley,2012). An example of action that was taken after this forum involves a group of high school students, Future Problem Solvers, from Russell County. These students created a community resource situation website that provides links to resources that could assist students who need help in order to graduate high school. These students also interviewed a number of high school dropout and created a documentary based on their findings and they have also produced a number of skits that are used in middle schools to educate younger students about the issue(McCauley,2012)(\u201cThe Central High School Dropout Project\u201d).The Mathews Center was one of three sponsors for an event titled, \u201cMaking Community Decisions about Alabama\u2019s Dropout Situation.\u201d The event encouraged deliberation and the solutions that resulted from the AIF by connecting organizations that focus on eliminating the dropout rate with citizens and communities, enabling civic action.</p><p>The 2012-2013 AIF focus is on the issue of bulling which was identified as a problem during the 2010-2011 AIF. The Center compiled research to create an issue map entitled, \u201cBullying: What is it? How do we prevent it?\u201d in which three frameworks detailing potential actions and consequences guide the participants through the deliberation. The Center participated in the 2nd Annual Auburn University Anti-Bullying Summit, \u201cBe a Hero, Take a Stand\u201d by holding a workshop entitled,\u201cCitizen\u2019s Congress: naming and Framing the Bullying Issue.\u201d The workshop provided The Mathews Center with the framework for their AIF issue map. The AIF deliberative discussions are using the issue map to come up with creative solutions to the bullying problem in Alabama.</p><p><u><strong>Coaching Community Innovation Workshops (CCI)</strong></u></p><p>Coaching Community Innovation (CCI) workshops are \u201cdesigned to improve community capacities to make innovative decisions, secure commitments to act together, and learn from experiences\u201d(\u201cCoaching Community Innovative Workshops\"). CCI workshops take place annually and include moderator and convener development workshops, reporting-out events, naming and framing workshops, and civic networking events.</p><p>Moderator and convener development workshops consist of a shortened forum experience, a discussion on moderating techniques, and a mock forum in which participants practice their moderating and recording skills. The shortened forum is an opportunity for participants to observe the moderator\u2019s techniques. The following discussion focuses on the DMC Moderator Development Handbook which outlines the aspects of moderating, questions to encourage deliberation, and provides ways help manage conflict. After the discussion, participants practice what they learned by participating in a mock forum in which participants take turns moderating and recording. The workshop ends with reflections on moderating and convening.</p><p>Naming and framing workshops allow for participants to define and raise questions about a problem, and then create a framework for decision making in which the community will deliberate. The naming process begins with discussing the many pieces involved in an issue and then discussing the relationship between the public and the issue at hand while taking personal concerns into account. To frame the issue, the discussion then gets centered on three approaches during which the citizens approve the framework and come up with suggestions to improve it. The participants then come up with examples of solutions and the consequences that might result.</p><p><u><strong>Teachers\u2019 Institute</strong></u></p><p>Teachers\u2019 Institute provides teachers with, \u201cthe understanding, skills, and tools to enhance lifelong civic learning and increase student engagement in the classroom\u201d(\u201cTeacher's Institute\"). Teachers practice deliberative skills, problem analysis, and moderator development exercises through an extended series of interactive sessions. The Mathews Center holds one annual Teachers\u2019 Institute at the American Village in Montevallo, Alabama.</p><p>Teachers participate in a shortened forum as an introduction to deliberation, they listen to presentations on how to incorporate deliberation into the classroom, and participate in discussions about the content that they were learning. They participate in a mock forum in which they practice their moderating and recording skills and the Institute concludes with teachers discussing ways that they can use deliberation in their schools. The Institute emphasizes the connection between teaching, learning, and democracy and how incorporating deliberation into the classroom can increase \u201ccivic engagement and ownership of learning\u201d(\u201cTeacher's Institute\").</p><p>The Teachers\u2019 Institute wants participants to learn and implement deliberation into classroom learning about current events and prepare students for participation in a democracy. Teachers learn to apply NIF in the classroom to national and state standards and also practice deliberation, problem analysis and moderator development. The Institute also provides teachers with the experience of deliberative conversation in a decision-making forum, they try out different ways to teach students deliberation, and the teachers study a variety of testing methods to use when fostering civic learning in the classroom.</p><p><u><strong>Citizens\u2019 Congress</strong></u></p><p>Citizens\u2019 Congress is an event that brings citizens together to focus on issues of concern in Alabama. Large discussions allow participants to name and frame a problem by, \u201csharing what they hold valuable in relation to the issue, identifying community-based approaches to addressing the issue, and sharing and actively listening to a variety of viewpoints on the issue\u201d(\u201cCitizen's Congress\u201d).The Mathews Center then uses the information gathered at the event to create an issue book or map to help deliberation during an AIF.</p><p>Citizens\u2019 Congress helps the Center name and frame an issue prior to every AIF. It is a biennial event that is open to public.</p><p>A Citizens\u2019 Congress took place on June 23, 2010 at the American Village where citizens were invited to help assess the dropout issue from the 2010-2011 AIF. 170 citizens participated in creating a decision making tool for the AIF.</p><p>Another Citizen\u2019s Congress took place at the \u201cBe a Hero, Take a Stand\u201d Summit in June, 2012. The congress focused on naming and framing the bullying issue by taking their values and relating them to the bullying problem, discussing community solutions, while sharing and listening to diverse voices which were compiled into an issue map to be used during the 2012-2013 AIF.</p><p><u><strong>The Jean O\u2019Conner-Synder Internship Program</strong></u></p><p>The Jean O\u2019Conner Snyder Internship Program, started in the 2008-2009 school year, is a community-based research internship program directed by The Mathews Center and the University of Alabama\u2019s New College. The program takes students from surrounding universities and provides them with learning experiences in which they \u201cresearch the use of deliberative practices to develop an on-going community capacity to address common concerns\u201d( \u201cInterns\u201d).</p><p>The students work with communities in the state to develop community-wide deliberation. The interns represent a diversity of majors and their research projects examine the possibilities for encorporating deliberation into their fields of interest.</p><p><u><strong>Joint Learning Programs with American Village</strong></u></p><p>The Mathews Center works with the American Village to create community learning programs for the thousands of students and teachers who visit the American Village annually.</p><p>Various retreats, workshops, and the Teachers\u2019 Institute take place at the American Village.</p><p>\u201cFounded in 1995, the American Village serves the Nation as an educational institution whose mission is to strengthen and renew the foundations of American liberty and self-government by engaging and inspiring citizens, leaders and stewards\u201d(\u201cMission &amp; Goals\u201d).</p><h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3><p>The Mathews Center is primarily funded by the Citizenship Trust and the American Village. The funds from the Citizenship Trust are shared with the Center for the development and education of citizens on the process of deliberation.</p><p>The University of Alabama\u2019s New College funds the overseeing staff member and interns who work within the Jean O\u2019Conner-Snyder Internship Program. This collaboration of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Center and the New College in which the interns assist and participate in the many programs that the Mathews Center offers to the community at large.</p><p>Vendor contracts with community foundations also assist in the funding of the Mathews Center for forums in which they will participate</p><p>Due to the non-profit status of the Mathews Center they use Conveners, people who donate their time and services to put together forums. These 40 Conveners from 30 counties perform a wide range of tasks such as sending out press releases, finding locations for the forums to take place, sending out email invites and much more(McCauley,2012).</p><h3><strong>Publications</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://mathewscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Center-Book.pdf\"><u>http://mathewscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Center-Book.pdf</u></a></p><p><a href=\"http://mathewscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DMCOPRebuild.pdf\"><u>http://mathewscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DMCOPRebuild.pdf</u></a></p><p><a href=\"http://mathewscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ForCommunitiesToWork.pdf\"><u>http://mathewscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/ForCommunitiesToWork.pdf</u></a></p><h3><strong>Sources</strong></h3><p>\"About Us.\" Mathewscenter.org.

[3]</p><h3>History</h3><p>Prior to 2010, redistricting in California was conducted by the California legislature. Since the party that controls the Assembly and Senate will appoint its own members to the redistricting commission, the entire process was marred by partisan politics. In fact, between 2000 and 2010 the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CA\"><u>California Congressional Delegation</u></a> was so safe that only one seat switched parties in 255 races. [4]</p><p>It was for this reason that a group of concerned citizens desired for an independant commission to take over the redistricting process. These citizens began a campaign for a voter-approved redistricting commission and hired <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Kimball_Petition_Management\">Kimball Petition Management</a> to collect the signatures required for ballot submittal. As an initiated constitutional amendment, 694,354 signatures were required for qualification. These signatures were submitted to election officials on May 6, 2008. On June 17th, 2008, the California Secretary of State announced that a check of the signatures established that the measure had indeed qualified as Proposition 11.</p><p><em><strong>California Proposition\u00a011 (2008) Election Results [18] (As of 11/14/12)</strong></em></p><p><strong>Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06,095,033\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 50.9%</strong></p><p>No\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5,897,655\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 49.1%</p><p>The commission was created in November 2008 following the passage of <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_11,_Creation_of_the_California_Citizens_Redistricting_Commission_(2008)\"><u>Proposition 11</u></a> in California (also known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_11_%282008%29\"><u>Voters First Act</u></a>). The passage of this measure created the commission and tasked them with redrawing the Senate, Assembly, and Board of Equalization districts in California. In 2010, <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_20,_Congressional_Redistricting_(2010)\"><u>Proposition 20</u></a> (also known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_20_%282010%29\"><u>Voters First Act for Congress</u></a>) was subsequently proposed. Proposition 20's passage assigned the responsibility of redrawing the state\u2019s Congressional District boundaries to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission as well. The Commission faced opposition from incumbent California politicians because \"many safe seats in the Legislature could suddenly become competitive.\" [6]</p><p><em><strong>California Proposition\u00a020 (2010) Election Results [19] (As of 11/14/12)</strong></em></p><p><strong>Yes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05,743,069\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 61.3%</strong></p><p>No\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03,636,892\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 38.7%</p><p>The passage of Proposition 11 and 20 authorized changes in the <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html\"><u>California Constitution</u></a> which required that the commission have 14 members, comprised of three groups of registered voters\u20145 who are registered with the largest political party in the state, 5 who are registered with the second largest political party in the state, and 4 who are not registered with either of these parties. The commissioners were selected in November and December 2010 and were required to complete the redistricting by August 15, 2011. [9]\u00a0Actions by the commission to adopt district boundaries required the approval of nine commissioners, including at least three \u201cyes\u201d votes from each of the three groups of commissioners. [9]</p><h3>Commission Selection and Processes</h3><p><strong><em>Commissioner Application</em></strong></p><p>After the passage of Proposition 11 in November 2008, the <a href=\"http://www.bsa.ca.gov/\"><u>California Bureau of State Audits</u></a> (BSA) adopted the stipulations to the Constitution on October 20, 2009. This paved the way for the Applicant Review Panel to be randomly selected on November 16, 2009. The website <a href=\"http://wedrawthelines.ca.gov\"><u>wedrawthelines.ca.gov </u></a>opened with an application to be on the commission. The application opened on December 15, 2009 and was available through February 16, 2010. Soon after, the BSA decided to add new regulations which stipulated that the first eight commissioners selected would interview and choose the remaining six.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.bsa.ca.gov/\"><u>California State Auditor</u></a> estimates that over 30,000 applications were received for the commission. After preliminary eliminations of incomplete applications and those not taken seriously, a secondary application was sent out to those who applied on February 17, 2010 and was available until April 19, 2010. 5,000 applications were resubmitted and from those a three-member panel from the BSA reviewed the applications and conducted interviews to establish a pool of 20 Democrats, 20 Republicans and 20 applicants from neither major party. This list of 60 names was then forwarded to the <a href=\"http://www.legislature.ca.gov/\"><u>California State Legislature</u></a> on September 29, 2010.</p><p>After the 60 finalists' names were received, the <a href=\"http://asmdc.org/speaker/\"><u>California Assembly Speaker</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://sd06.senate.ca.gov/\"><u>California Senate President Pro Tempore</u></a>, and the minority leaders of both the Assembly and the Senate jointly reduced the pool to 12 members within each\u00a0pool as required by law. The Legislature sent this list of names on November 12, 2010 back to the State Auditor who then randomly drew three Democrats, three Republicans and two applicants\u00a0from neither major party to become commissioners. These eight commissioners were notified of their selection on November 18, 2010 and were quickly tasked with selecting the other six commissioners from the remaining pool by December 15, 2010.</p><p><em><strong>Selected Commissioners</strong></em></p><p>Executive Director</p><ul><li>Daniel Claypool</li></ul><p>Democrats</p><ul><li>Gabino Aguirre -\u00a0Former farm worker from Santa Paula, CA</li><li>Angelo Ancheta - Law professor and legal scholar from San Francisco, CA</li><li>Maria Blanco - Vice-President of the California Community Foundation from Los Angeles, CA</li><li>Cynthia Dai -\u00a0A social venture consultant from San Francisco, CA</li><li>Jeanne Raya - A commercial insurance agent from San Gabriel, CA</li></ul><p>Republicans</p><ul><li>Vincent Barraba - Founder of an online marketing company from Capitola, CA</li><li>Jodie Filkins Webber - A self-employed insurance litigation defense attorney from Norco, CA</li><li>Lilbert \"Gil\" R.

A community of interest is defined as a population area that shares similar social and economic interests.</li><li>Geographic Compactness - All districts must not bypass nearby communities for more distant communities.</li><li>Nesting - Each Senate district shall comprise two whole Assembly districts. Board of Equalization districts shall be comprised of 10 Senate districts.</li></ol><p><em><strong>Ensuring Transparency</strong></em></p><p>Incumbents, candidates or political parties could not be consulted during the district drawing process. Article XXI section 2(d) of the California Constitution also required that the Commission \"conduct an open and transparent process enabling full public consideration and comment on the drawing of district lines.\" [14] Taking this into consideration, the Commission facilitated 34 hearings across the state and had 2700 citizens offer public testimony.</p><p>Organizations such as the <a href=\"http://ca.lwv.org/\" title=\"League of Women Voters\"><u>League of Women Voters</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.cafwd.org/\"><u>California Forward</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.commoncause.org/\" title=\"Common Cause\"><u>Common Cause</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.calchamber.com/\" title=\"California Chamber of Commerce\"><u>California Chamber of Commerce (CalChamber)</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.eqca.org/\" title=\"Equality California\"><u>Equality California</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.maldef.org/\" title=\"Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF)\"><u>Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF)</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.apalc.org/\" title=\"Asian Pacific American Legal Center\"><u>Asian Pacific American Legal Center</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/\" title=\"National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\"><u>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://svlg.org/\" title=\"Silicon Valley Leadership Group\"><u>Silicon Valley Leadership Group</u></a>, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club\" title=\"Sierra Club\"><u>Sierra Club</u></a> also offered testimony to the Commission. The Commission's <a href=\"http://wedrawtheline.ca.gov\"><u>website</u></a> also received 20,000 public comments that were taken into consideration. [13] [14]</p><p><strong><em>Map Controversy</em></strong></p><p>Since the process was so transparent, public testimony was often partisan in nature. These citizens hoped to influence the Commission during the hearing process to ensure that the new districts would be favorable to their political affiliation. In a very controversial article, investigative journalism publisher <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/\" title=\"ProPublica\"><u>ProPublica</u></a> found evidence that the <a href=\"http://www.cadem.org/\" title=\"California Democratic Party\"><u>California Democratic Party</u></a> coordinated with members of the community to manipulate the process. [7] The <a href=\"http://cagop.org/\" title=\"California Republican Party\"><u>California Republican Party</u></a> was quick to call for an investigation, despite the fact that many members of the media believe the California Republican Party to have conducted similar efforts. [5]\u00a0In response, the Commission issued a press release to ensure the public that it \"had its eyes wide open\" and \"were not unduly influenced.\" [7] The State Auditor conducted a brief investigation and determined that even if the testimony was of partisan influence it was the first amendment rights of those citizens to do just so. Thus, no action needed to be taken and any further complaints could be taken up with the courts. [10]</p><p>In 2012, the opponents of the California Redistricting Commission decided instead to take their concerns to the ballot box. [10] On November 13, 2011 several concerned citizen sponsors turned in 504,760 signatures to qualify a \"map repeal\" measure to the ballot. If passed, this measure would ask the California Legislature re-draw the State Senate districts while leaving the other maps intact. On February 24, 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.sos.ca.gov/\" title=\"California Secretary of State\"><u>California Secretary of State</u></a>'s office announced that the measure indeed qualified and would be classified as Proposition 40; although the language was very confusing to the average voter. [10] A \"Yes\" vote meant that the districts would be kept while a \"No\" vote would ask the California Legislature to redraw the districts once more.</p><p>While originally the California Republican Party took a stance against this proposition it was decided in Mid-July that they would abandon their \"No on Proposition 40\" campaign. [11] The Republican Party believed that after seeing primary election results the new districts were sufficient and switched their endorsement to \"Yes on 40.\" Thus, both the California Republican and Democratic parties campaigned in favor of 40 to the point in which it was approved in the November 6, 2012 General Election.

[9] It was put to a vote using the \"supermajority\" that was stipulated by Article XXI section 2(c) and 2(g) of the California Constitution. Maps for the State Legislature passed each with a 13-1 vote. Maps for the Congressional districts passed with a 12-2 vote. [6]</p><h3>Courtroom Challenges</h3><p><strong><em>Vandermost v. Bowen</em></strong></p><p>In January of 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm\"><u>California Supreme Court</u></a> declared that the State Senate redistricting maps generated by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission were constitutional; finding them in compliance with both the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html\"><u>United States Constitution</u></a> and the California Constitution. [21] The justices also ruled unanimously that pursuant to 2008's Proposition 11, the new maps could be used in the 2012 General Election (Even if Proposition 40 qualified for the ballot, which it did).</p><p>In response to the filing of additional lawsuits, the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/\"><u>United States Department of Justice</u></a> granted preclearance of the Commission's maps under Section 5 of the Federal Voting Rights Act. [8] This streamlined the map implementation and ensured that they would take effect during the June 12th, <a href=\"http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/2012-elections/june-primary/\"><u>2012 Presidential Primary</u></a> even if litigation was still pending. [8]</p><h3>Long Term Impacts</h3><p>While it can be difficult to judge the impact of non-partisan redistricting right away, independent studies completed by the <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/\" title=\"Public Policy Institute of California\"><u>Public Policy Institute of California</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/\" title=\"National Journal\"><u>National Journal</u></a>, and <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/\" title=\"Ballotpedia\"><u>Ballotpedia</u></a> have concluded that California now has some of the most competitive legislative districts in America. [1]\u00a0This creates a breadth of opportunities for elected officials to face their constituents and ensures that elections are more focused on substance than turnout.</p><p>After the November 6, 2012 presidential election many in the media and the political community are using the California Citizens Redistricting Commission as precedent for future independent redistricting commissions. While its results may have caused some longtime incumbents to lose primary races, it opened up a \"new broad base of constituents\" as stated by newly elected Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell who beat 30 year incumbent Pete Stark. [12] While the article agrees that the immediate impact has been impressive, \"it will take a few elections to truly judge the effectiveness of California's new voting and redistricting reforms.\" [12]</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Under Proposition 11, the Legislature would continue to appropriate funding for the redistricting of U.S. House of Representatives districts. In addition, this measure authorizes funding (outside of the Legislature's budget) for redistricting efforts related to legislative and Board of Equalization districts. Here is a breakdown of that funding:</p><p><strong>Total Redistriciting Approprations and expenditures<a

They believe in complete freedoms of speech and openness, free from censorships, wire-tapping, and the inability to be anonymous. In reference to privacy laws, they hope to gain the same rights as their parents did 40 years ago (TEDxTalks). Those rights including, not being virtually monitored or tracked on the Internet and postal service. \u00a0Ultimately, they want to be able to send information or letters on the Internet or by postal with ease and comfort of privacy, because 40 years ago this sort of tracking did not exist to such an extent.\u00a0</p><p>As for in the United States, The pirate movement also believes in eliminating the current welfare system and creating higher taxes but with a minimum income assurance, meaning that every person is given enough money to live off of. \u201cThis forces businesses to compete against the government and treat their employees well, as well as give them a decent wage. It also prevents any person from starving, going without healthcare, reduces violence and break-ins significantly\u201d (McCrea).</p><p>Their message is based on the idea of politics of protest, protesting to change the status quo.\u00a0 One can compare their missions of protest similar to those like the Greens who wanted to protest pollution and Liberals who protested the royal\u2019s overbearing power control on the church. These protests and movements became established politics and policy makers all because they turned something into an ideology, similar to the Pirate Party (TEDxTalks).</p><h3>History</h3><p>The Pirate Party originated in Sweden by founder Rickard Falkvinge on January 1, 2006, originally being named \u201cPiratpartiet.\u201d \u00a0Non-supporters had giving them the name of \u2018pirates\u2019, in hopes of shaming them from the idea that they like sharing and copying (TEDxTalks).\u00a0 Falkvinge expresses that he became a politician by talking about politics in a pub and later increasing to a political leader that has parties present in over 56 countries.</p><p>Upon creating the party, Falkvinge saw three objections he had from the European Government in 2005.\u00a0 First off, there was the software patents debate in parliament that would criminalize knowledge. Secondly, there was copyright monopoly harshening in Sweden.\u00a0 And lastly, the data retention direction in Sweden, which would make all cellular phones contain tracking devices issued by the government (TEDxTalks).\u00a0</p><p>The first steps Rickard Falkvinge took to starting the Pirate Party was making a manifesto on an online chat of a mere few sentences. Within his first day, the party consisted of about 300 activists and supporters.\u00a0 At this point in the creation of the party, elections for the European Parliament of 2006 were only eight months away.\u00a0 There was increase in support and activisms within those months and they received .68% in the first election. However, due to the lack of funds, Falkvinge was forced to beg for money and donations, ultimately being chastised by non-supporters and tabloids.\u00a0 For the reelections 18 months later, the Pirate party received 7.13% votes and gained two seats in the European Parliament (TEDxTalks).\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>The official Pirate Party can be broken up into different sections depending on location and region around the World. \u00a0This allows organization and ease when planning meetings or gatherings because people and members are relatively close together.\u00a0 Pirate Party International (PPI), a non-governmental organization founded in 2010, helps to connect the party together even at such a large spectrum (PP International).\u00a0 It reinforces guidelines and communication, as well as promoting the cause, for all Pirate Parties internationally.\u00a0 The PPI bridges the gap for all Pirate Parties and can help establish new local parties in select countries. Pirate Party members are extremely diversified, coming from different backgrounds, allowing the ability for deliberation within the group possible and accessible. There are currently 29 active members from five continents that assist to the needs and run the PPI organization (PP International). Within the members, there is a board of directors who deliberate on issues regarding the organization and external issues manages the PPI.\u00a0</p><p>The United States also has many local parties of pirates.\u00a0 They can be labeled as the United States Pirate National Committee (PNC) and then categorized more within states individually through membership.\u00a0 The PNC originated with the mindset of bringing the United States parties together, similar to the PPI.\u00a0 By having a centralized organization and committee, they can have collaborating and deliberation between local state parties and promote events properly.\u00a0</p><p>Within the PNC, there are also different levels of membership, member and observer states. Member states have established parties with delegates who attend the National Committee meetings. Members are authorized to have complete voting privileges at deliberations and have the authority to approve new members by a majority vote. Observer States are encouraged to attend national committee meetings but do not posses the same status as member states. Observer states can eventually gain membership but must establish an organization with enough activists and members.\u00a0 (United States Pirate Party).</p><p><strong>Participation Selection\u00a0</strong></p><p>Participation in Pirate parties is voluntary, anyone can join. The best way to get involved is to sign up at one of the Pirate Parties websites, chat, contribute, or through social media. Some Pirate parties offer Student Internships, where students can get college credit for helping their pirate party. This will also allow \u00a0Pirate Parties to continue being very popular amongst the younger generation.<br /><br />Individuals can also get involved by managing Pirate Parties Internationals social media sites by volunteering part time. responsibilities for volunteer social media networkers will help develop an on going social media plan. While also updating, planning, and strategizing emerging trends and opportunities. \u00a0Volunteers must monitor, track, interpret and leverage all social media trends. Main function is to supervise and regulate Pirate Parties International's social media and platforms.</p><p>If interested parties wish to ask them a question, you can email them asking them about anything you like by going to their website.</p><p><strong>Deliberation, Decissions, and Public Interaction</strong></p><p>Just like any other organization, Pirate Parties throughout the world hold meetings via web chat where people can bring their ideas for the Pirate Parties forum, government crowd sourcing, platform, website, and campaigns. They have a public forum for new participants to introduce themselves to other participants. Find out about current events and get links to articles and commentary.<br /><br />The meetings forum includes the months meeting agenda, and any other issues that need to be addressed. The political council forum is for extra meeting discussions on topics like civil liberties write up, privacy write up, protecting free culture, and democratic engagement. Along with other forums for decision making for standing committees, projects, parties, local events, and records/archives.<br /><br />One of the events the Pirate Parties International puts on is Pirate Con. An annual national convention of all pirates around the World. That holds conferences in London, UK. At Pirate Con people have the opportunity to watch debates and find out what's going on in Pirate Parties. The participants input is used as a platform that helps shape the Pirate Parties agenda in Parliament and other countries. \u00a0Pirate Con allows people to get involved in many ways. From discussions, trainings, networkings, and sharing their personal experiences and advice.</p><h3>Influence, Outcome and Effects</h3><p>The issues pirates hope to tackle include copyright laws, reinforce and protect fair dealing, and decriminalizing non-commercial sharing and to limit copyright to commercial use of a product. Pirate parties believe the internet is a invaluable good, and hope to resist any censorship, and regulation of the internet. Part of their belief is that they feel this is a violation of our First Amendments rights, to be protected from having their mail read, especially over the internet. They seek to reform election and lobbying laws, limiting the amount of power and money politicians can receive in private donations. Tackling direct democracy and participation, without the fear of repression. They also support social economic justice and the value of the little people over large corporations, the 1%.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism\u00a0</h3><p>Pirate Parties have been known for their lack of solid platform and coherence in sticking to policies. As well as admitting to having gaps in their resources, people worry they may be connected to neo-Nazi National Democratic Parties.<br /><br />Pirate's are known to copy, paste, and share on the internet. They stand by their civil liberties and choose to rise up and protect their beliefs and now have 2 seats in European Parliament, 15 seats in the Berlin parliament, 150+ seats in local councils across europe, and presently in 56 countries across the world.<br /><br />One major criticism is that people in Hollywood don't believe that there is anything noble about pirate parties or pirate bay, because they illegally steal copyright content and accept money for what they do. Another Criticism of Pirate Parties is that people see \u00a0Pirate Parties working to reinvent politics. Some say that Pirate Parties are Glorifying hackers as a significant force. While others accuse members of the Germany Pirate parties to be members of the right wing extremist National Democratic party of Germany (NDP). As we know Pirate Parties are \"opposed to pointless storage of telephone and internet connection data of all citizens. That existing copyright law is just as out moded as the current patent system. Rejecting all forms of web censorship or warning messages on illegal web content.\"</p><p>Pirate Parties transparent participation is easily accessible by supporters and opposers in the ever so controversial parties web chat meetings on their website. People can immediately see what is said and being done in all Pirate Parties meetings.</p><h3>Secondary Sources\u00a0</h3><p>McCrea, T. (2012, October 17).

In many areas of the U.S., minority populations are still discriminated against. For instance, people of color are refused of public services or political participation. According to statistics from United States Census of Bureau, the State of California is composed mostly of people of color and white Hispanic (60.3%) rather than white Americans (39.7%). However, they are still considered a minority population because they are often underserved, neglected, and discriminated against. \u00a0They still suffer from unequal treatment on jobs, lack of homeownership, lack of higher education.</p><p>The main focus of the Greenlining Institute is to arouse the public\u2019s awareness of issues related to racial discrimination and inequality by instituting change, on both an institutional and state scale. The Greenlining Institution provides resources such as training and funding to people of color; additionally, it gives them ability to speak for themselves and also help other people. The Greenlining Institute empowers minorities to speak for themselves and help other people of color. In a word, it not only gives people of color fish but also teaches them how to fish.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The Greenlining Institute was founded in San Francisco in 1993 by Robert Gnaizda, John Gamboa and in conjunction of members of diverse ethnic groups: Asian American, African American, and Latino American. The members committed themselves to fight against redlining activities and institutional discrimination, and advocated for social change. After several informal discussions, they first found the Greenlining Coalition with around twelve members. Now the Greenlining Institute has over forty members.</p><h3>Participation</h3><p>The Greenlining Institute provides the opportunity to over 100 young college graduates a year to receive leadership skills and gain insight into discrimination facing minority populations. College graduates can apply to the institute\u2019s training program, or fellowship and internship opportunity, via online application and selection, as it says on its institute website, is fair and open to everyone. These participants are given the chance to become directly involved in Greenlining Institute's research and event planning. By involving more youth in social movements and making more people learn about current issues, the Greenlining Institute gives the young equipment of power and skills advocating solutions for problems.</p><p>The <em>Greenlining Coalition</em> composed of nearly forty member corporations and organizations that all aim to achieve common goal to build an equal society and more opportunity for people of color.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decision, and Public Interation</h3><p>The Greenlining Institute holds two-day Economic Summit every year. The Economic Summit is not just literally about economics. It also includes about other topics such as social justice and politics. Mostly, the institute invites leaders from government, banking, nonprofit and community groups to address problems related to these fields and find possible solutions. (The Greenlining Institute) Yet, Economic Summit is sometimes open to the public as well. People can get free admission tickets via <em>Eventbite </em>website. Deliberation process is basically to invite presenters, often those leaders, to introduce problems and present their views or stand to other participants. And, in these summits, moderators were often faculty from the Greenlining Institute. Participants of The Economic Summit will brainstorm and work together to develop an agenda.</p><p>The Greenlining Institute helps public interaction by conducting researches and publishing useful information to equip citizens, especially minority communities, with more knowledge. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>For example, it translated California Voter Guide into three languages: English, Spanish, and Chinese. California Voter Guide does help deliberation, decision, and public interaction. For one, provided in three languages, the guide provides more accesses to people of non-native speakers to learn of the election and therefore also help provide equality of opportunity to participate in the politics. For another, California Voter Guide invokes California residents\u2019 awareness of the importance of this election. It offers information that is free and therefore makes people of lower incomes have an access to participate. California Voter Guide helps more people have more knowledge of the election and therefore helps the people make better decisions. Except educating citizens, the Greenlining Institute also questioned politicians for minority communities. For instance, Orson Aguilar, the executive director of the Greenlining Institute, published a news article on how candidates answered and viewed questions raised by the Greenlining Institute about poverty and people of color in the United States. The Greenlining Institute, during the presidential debate, also asked candidates to provide envisions for solving these problems. And, the answer for questions from candidates was \u201cpathetic\u201d, according to timeunion.com and the Greenlining Institute. What the Greenlining Institute was doing is to call presidential candidates\u2019 attention to face the racial issues facing in the United States. And, since it was during the presidential debate, the Greenlining Institute also raised awareness of the audience of the debate.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcome, and Effects</h3><p>The Greenlining Institute established Leader Academy in 1996, an institution to train young leaders. And, in order to ensure diversity of California public school, the Greenlining Institute uses Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources to connect people of color. Moreover, in response to recent increase in textbooks and tuition, the Greenlining Institute tried to make higher education more affordable by influencing or lobbying politicians and educational institutions. Also, The Greenlining Institute had been successful in using telecommunication technology. The institute collected funds to educate those underserved and low-income communities on the use of telecommunications technology which could help people deliberate and speak up for themselves. (The Greenlining Institute)The Greenlining Institution conducts and publishes many researches in many areas including politics, economics, and education on its own website which is free-access and therefore the public is welcome to learn more about issues and the institution. The Greenlining Institute provides a-year- long fellowship opportunity to youngsters of completed undergraduate degree. The fellowship program will give youngsters opportunity to participate in discussion of policies and therefore make those students have deeper understanding of policies and some related issues and realize importance of the policies and issues.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>The Greenlining Institute has been accused of being money-oriented. According to Consumer Watchdog, the Greenlining Institute favored the side of those corporations and organizations donated much money to the Greenlining Institute. On the one hand, the Greenlining Institute claims itself a non-profit organization working for minority communities. On the other hand, it was accused of not heading to its aim. The followings were examples of incidents the two sources raised. For one, the Greenlining Institute supports Proposition 33 which claimed to be adverse to low-income, new drivers and college students due to surcharge from insurance companies. Consumer Watchdog website argues the Greenlining Institution\u2019s support of Proposition 33 is due to receive of funding from Mercury Insurance Company\u2019s chairman, George Joseph who funded and sponsored Proposition 33. The Greenlining Institute is criticized for not making choices based on helping minority communities but on amount of donation it receives.</p><p>Another example is an argument between FTCR (The Foundation for Taxpayer &amp; Consumer Rights) and The Greenlining Institute on the Proposition 9 which rose by FTCR claiming to prevent utility companies, especially those private ones, from surcharging customers and also provide an additional rate reduction. (Smart Voter) The Greenlining Institute was on opposed side of this proposition. Consumer Watch Dog website claimed that the Greenlining Institute did not support Proposition 9 was because of receiving much money from the stakeholders, utility companies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>The Greenlining Institute: <a href=\"http://greenlining.org/index.php\">http://greenlining.org/index.php</a></p><p>John Gizzi, \u201c<em>California\u2019s Greenlining Institute: Arm-Twisting for Financial Affirmative Action</em>\u201d.

The institution was established in 2009 and was one of the first of its kind. Using a web-based blog platform, they make community members aware of the deliberations they are sponsoring in the area. Blog entries on their website are posted detailing the subject of the deliberation and time and place at which the deliberation will occur and how to become a participant. Subjects of the deliberation are locally chosen. Currently, another function of the website is to make people aware of important news and happenings regarding deliberations occurring worldwide, so the creators regularly post entries regarding vital news about deliberations. The CVDNVA prides itself on being non-partisan and entirely volunteer run.</p><p>\u00a0Since their creation in 2009, their motto has been \u201ca chance to be heard is a reason to listen.\u201d The founders, Bill Corbet and Beth Offenbacker, designed this organization with the goal of trying to educate the public on the importance of participation in political life. In the Northern Virginia area, the creators became aware that there was distinct interest in being involved in deliberative discussions on important issues but that there was a lack of opportunity for them to do so. The Center for Voter Deliberation in Northern Virginia ideally wishes to give people that chance, a chance to give their representatives real and constructive feedback on policies and issues in the national and local area. With the formation of this organization, students and community members now have that option, the option to participate in a real deliberation on actual issues.\u00a0</p><h3>Purpose and Problems</h3><p>\u00a0Since its founding in 2009, the purpose of the Center for Voter Deliberation in Northern Virginia has always been to give people in the community a chance to voice their opinions on a variety of issues facing the American people.\u00a0 It is rooted in the idea that people need to come together and talk about issues, this way they can come to a consensus and give their representatives more accurate information on what the people want. The idea is that America would move towards a more deliberative form of democracy.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia does give the community an influx of new ways to engage in deliberation, it requires that the participants to seek out their website and find time in their busy schedules to volunteer and participate. \u00a0Time community members most likely don\u2019t have to spare. \u00a0Since there is no compensation for their time, the center has to count on people to be willing to participate without an incentive.\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The Center for Voter Deliberation was created with the hope of working with other organizations in the area to design and carry out deliberations on locally selected topics. The founders intended for this to be a way for the community to move towards a more deliberative democracy, a democracy where people think, talk, and act together. For the past few years, CVDNVA has organized numerous study circles, public forums, and deliberations. They developed this organization with the design that with a more educated and involved community of voters participating in the American system, then democracy will thrive. Through the deliberations organized by the CVDNVA ideally the informed voters will be able to make better decisions and improve the community. \u00a0The Prince William Study Circles was even the winner of the Virginia Statewide Neighborhood Organization of the year award in 2009 (Brookshire 2009). \u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The structure of this organization is dependent on it being non-partisan; therefore participation is volunteer based. In an effort to be inclusive of all those eligible to vote, participation is open to anyone living in the community and willing to participate.\u00a0 For the convenience of participants, deliberations usually take place in public areas such as a library or cafe. Their desire to remain a non-partisan organization requires that a participant\u2019s personal views are not taken into consideration when selecting participants.\u00a0 Therefore they are asked no questions about personal beliefs before being selected to participate. The ultimate objective is to foster discussion between regular citizens who want to discuss issues that are affecting them. Being passionate about issues is very key to the success of these forums.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the online deliberations on Second Life are open to anyone. On their blog, they will post information about times and the issues that will be discussed and then people who want to participate need to create an avatar on Second Life and then return to The Center for Voter Deliberation website and register their avatar on the blog entry.\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberations, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia strives to promote deliberations among neighbors in their specific community. Deliberations are often small consisting of around 15 people. The deliberations typically take place in public spaces, like colleges and libraries. There is always a trained facilitator that The Center for Voter Deliberation in Northern Virginia appoints to moderate the session. The first forum planned by this organization took place on April 3rd in 2009.\u00a0 Residents and local experts convened to talk about the choices presented in a <a href=\"http://www.nifi.org/\">National Issues Forum\u00a0</a>(NIF) which frames the issue of Health Care for the purpose of public deliberation.\u00a0 There were four deliberations that took place at the locations of the Prince William Campus, Big Bear Caf\u00e9 in Washington DC, Bus Boys and Poets in Washington DC, and Prince William Area Commission on Aging. The forums that took place in Washington DC were much larger and the participants were more liberal overall than the ones that took place in Northern Virginia. Facilitators from CVDNVA helped moderate the deliberation for ninety minutes on three solutions as to how to handle the health care problem. The forum attracted 155 people in total. They didn\u2019t arrive at a consensus, but surveys showed that people wanted lower costs and fewer people uninsured.</p><p>Furthermore, they co-convene the Prince William Study circles which currently organize seven study circles in their city which are made up of 15 diverse residents. The study circles are six hours long and moderated by a member of the Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia. The goal is make a decision on local issues and try and take action.\u00a0 According to the assistant dean of Prince William university life, \u201cWe decided to get the community talking and to have a respectful, honest and productive conversation about neighborhood issues. The whole point of the circles is to empower the community to take the initiative\u201d (Musick 2010). The study circles were formed to help community members take action and improve their community.</p><p>Since then the organization has entered into the arena of online deliberation as well using a forum called Second Life. People interested in the Deliberation will register on the website and then log into second life at the specific time posted on the website. Second Life is a 3D virtual chat rooms used for many things, deliberations being one of them.\u00a0 While it is online, it allows people to interact just like they would at a real meeting. Before the deliberations, orientations on how to use Second Life are given on specific days because knowing how to use the forum is critical to the success of the deliberation. Once participants are signed up on the day of the deliberation, they are assigned a table and small group within the virtual realm. Each table has a CVDNVA moderator there. Usually the online forums are also sponsored by other organizations around the country in order to create a larger deliberation. For example, The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia was one of the 6 sponsors for an online America Speaks\u2019 National Discussion \u201cOur Budget, Our Economy.\u201d\u00a0 During this virtual online deliberation, there was an introduction section, then three choices were discussed, then benefits and trade-offs, and then a wrap up section during the deliberation.</p><p>Decisions are most often made through intense discussion of several solutions and then participants attempt to come to a consensus on how to move forward and take action to improve their neighborhood.\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effect\u00a0</h3><p>The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia was created with the idea that creating opportunities for people to deliberate on issues would help to educate the public not only on issues but also on how important it is for every citizen to be involved in politics. American citizens are so fortunate to have the opportunity to have a say in the government but so many people do not take advantage of this chance to make a difference. The American democratic system has so much possible potential. By giving people an opportunity to discuss and work through issues, and hear other people\u2019s stances on current problems facing their neighborhood, this helps them to make an informed decision and know exactly how to take action.\u00a0 A well-informed public is critical to creating a more deliberative democracy and a better America.\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism\u00a0</h3><p>The Center for Voter Deliberation of Northern Virginia is a way for citizens who want to become more politically active to have an opportunity to do so. Through blog entries they alert the community to deliberations they are sponsoring and to exciting news regarding deliberations all over the world. Barriers to deliberation using this organization could include inequality. Discussion norms could cause people\u2019s opinions to be swayed by participants with a gift for speaking and persuasion. One side of the issue could be portrayed in a better light based on who said it and how it is said. An additional barrier could include the spiral of silence. People commonly feel less of an enticement to speak up if they feel like the majority of the group has common beliefs they do not share. Especially since these deliberations are technically non-partisan when the participants are selected they do not control for the possibility of a majority of the group sharing similar political beliefs.\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Brookshire, C.

One of the main focuses of the project is foremost to find ways to make decisions in which they can involve citizens in making decisions about the environment. This project allows ordinary citizens who hold no power in politics who have an interest in finding ways to reduce climate change have the possibility in influencing what politicians decide. Throughout the years this project has grown to have more than 4,000 citizens representing more than 38 countries. Some of these 38 countries include Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Spain, and the United States of America.</p><p><strong>PROBLEMS AND PURPOSE</strong></p><p>This project states that because citizens must live with the consequences of climate policies, each individual\u2019s view should be taken into consideration. There has not been a systematic and comprehensive global citizen consultancy on climate change that has been organized before this project. Thus WWViews\u2019 mission is to change that and create an example for citizen\u2019s inclusion in policymaking on the topic of climate change.</p><p>\u00a0Citizen Participation is a crucial factor in this project. Citizen Participation is vital because it permits WWViews to have a multiplicity of viewpoints on different political issues that allows for well-rounded decisions. They hold a strong belief in deliberation and believe that when done right, it leads to more successful decisions. They say that deliberation is now a factor that is seen in many countries\u2019 democratic models, but they also mention that deliberation among citizens in this format is new, which means that it solely happens at a grass-roots level. Citizen participation is seen in the national meetings held around the world with around 100 citizens participating in each meeting. The strength of this idea not only exists on a national level, but also a trans-national level. This project is carefully created in grasping the way in which deliberation, if done the right way, can bring many initiative ideas to the table to find ways in resolving complicated issues revolving around climate change and global warming.</p><p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p><p>The Danish Board of Technology, which is an independent council overseen by the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Development, initiated the project in September of 2009. The reason for the idea of this project stemmed from the democratic gap that the board viewed between the citizens and policy makers. The debate on climate change has a history of being controlled by politicians, scientists, and powerful interest groups, which lacked the average person\u2019s input. The board believed that if climate change were going to be globally addressed, citizens would need to be included in the deliberation because these citizens would be the individuals implementing the decisions made.</p><p>During their first workshop in 2008, the cornerstones of the WWViews method were decided with the help of the initial WWViews partners. These cornerstones included: Cheap and easy (viable for all countries to participate, no matter an individual's income), Clear link to policy-making (including pertinent issues to policy-makers), Both global and national (allowing for relevant to global and national decisions), Clear and comparable results (easily communicated across different countries), Informed citizens (balancing the understanding of information), Deliberation (discussing all view points), and Qualitative and quantitative (allowing for a multitude of various questions to be answered). With this as their foundation, the board planned to set up deliberations with approximately one hundred citizens in each of the 38 countries to meet with each other. In these deliberations, the citizens at each forum would be asked the same set of question, no matter the country, and would be put in equal meeting designs. The deliberations would last one full day, allowing for thorough and detailed responses. To allow for uniform communication, the board decided on a set of twelve questions, which allowed for cross-national comparisons and differences to be gathered. These twelve questions were bunched into four themes: \u201cClimate change and its consequences\u201d, \u201cLong-term climate goal and urgency\u201d, \u201cDealing with greenhouse gas emissions\u201d, and \u201cThe economy of technology and adaptation\u201d. Because the questions were predetermined, the board also allowed for citizens at the meetings to also devise additional questions, which would be voted on between the people attending the deliberation. Focus groups and an international scienti\ufb01c advisory board verified that the twelve questions chosen were appropriate for the deliberation meetings.</p><p>In order to help educate citizens that were present at each deliberation, a forty-page information booklet and informational videos were produced, so that the most pressing and essential information was given to each individual. These booklets and videos were translated into the country\u2019s local language. Also, project managers and WWViews national partners all gathered in Copenhagen in March 2009, a year prior to WWViews Day, so that they could be trained for a better understanding of the project. In addition, a web tool was created so that results from WWViews meetings could be compared and presented to people all across the world.</p><p><strong>PARTICIPANT SELECTION</strong></p><p>First, WWView national partners were selected. These partners were responsible for organizing the meetings in their specific country or region. There were four guidelines that a national partner needed to meet in order to be approved. First, they had to have some type of knowledge and experience in citizen participation methods. Second, they could hold any bias either way for their opinion of climate change. Third, they must agree to follow a common guideline that all national partners would follow in the meetings. Fourth, for monetary sake, they would need to self-finance their own participation in WWViews.</p><p>Next, participants for the meetings were chosen. To guarantee that the results were trustworthy, guidelines for how participants were selected were set. First of all, the citizens chosen from each country would reflect the demographics of the specific country. These demographics included aspects such as age, gender, occupation, educational level, and geographical region of residency. If national partners of WWViews believed it was appropriate to add more demographic criteria, then further guidelines, such as race or ethnic groups, would also be a factor in the selection process. In addition, participants who were selected could not be experts on climate change or be scientists in that field. This allowed for the average person to be able to give their input, without contribution for those with scientific expertise.</p><p>According to reports from the partners of WWViews, the participating countries have followed these guidelines for selecting participants. However, there is a lack of representation for individuals who fit the criteria of having a lower education. Another problem that some countries have faced in the selection process is that while some countries recruit from the entire population of citizens, other countries choose to solely recruit from a select geographic area of citizens, which helps them cut the expenses of the selection process.</p><p><strong>DELIBERATION, DECISIONS, AND PUBLIC INTERACTION</strong></p><p>The main theme of the World Wide Views on Global Warming organization is to bring citizens across borders discuss an issue that does not respect borders. The deliberation process entails many details in order for it to have an effective outcome that can have potential in resolving the issues on global warming. Individuals and institutions such as government agencies, NGOs and universities host the deliberations around the world.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> What makes the deliberation process so detailed focus is the international dimension of the project.</p><p>For the deliberation process to run smoothly and accordingly to reach their ultimate goal to make a global climate action plan, participants must be well knowledge on what \u201cCitizen Participation\u201d is and the role it plays on such a wide scale conference. Citizen participation \"nourishes the plurality of perspectives on political issues, which makes for more thorough and well-grounded decisions.\"<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>Citizen participation and deliberation is the main foundation for the deliberation process across borders to garner successful results. It is not enough for citizens to attend the conferences and pay close attention to what goes on but it is a crucial aspect for each citizen to input their own views and opinions for the wheels of the project to move in the right direction. Also, citizens will have the chance to learn what politicians and experts on the issue of global climate think and to hear what opposing views have to say about the issue. With all this in regard, the citizens will come to a conclusion that integrates their own views and knowledge, life experiences, and all the new information that they have come to learn. \u00a0</p><p>Approximately 100 citizens attended each conference in different countries. With having a background on the issues that were discussed during the meetings and given more information at the meetings this ensure that the citizens could have an intellectual and thorough discussion. This also allowed to compare if politicians and stakeholder truly have the public\u2019s best interest by comparing what they think should be done about global warming and what the citizens really think the plan of action should be. We all live under this planet and climate change will affect us all, no matter what position you hold in society, so without a doubt the voices of the citizens needed to be heard instead of just the few politicians who might know or not know what is truly the best path to take concerning this issue. The discussion phase of the conference sets a more intimate setting as the participants are divided into smaller groups with a well knowledgeable and neutral moderator. This ensures better discussion since opinions will be heard more and more thoroughly. This is where the method of citizen participation is more crucial. Their knowledge, respect of other views, and opinions should all shine in these small group discussions in order for the collective decisions to be more accurate and rounded. The discussion is divided into four consecutives sessions of deliberation and voting on the issues presented. Also at the end of each discussion, each participant in each group had to fill a questionnaire that would ask them questions regarding the theme of the discussion that they just had. The four discussion themes were:<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a></p><p>1.\u201cClimate change and its consequences\u201d</p><p>2.\u201cLong-term climate goal and urgency\u201d</p><p>3. \u201cDealing with greenhouse gas emissions\u201d</p><p>4.\u201cThe economy of technology and adaptation\u201d</p><p>The decision process is quite simple since the groups are small. The decisions process is based on the issues related to those of the COP15, which at the end were curated into recommendations for negotiation. The voting process also had its own thematic areas. The thematic areas in which the participants voted on were: Climate Policy Goals, Burden Sharing, and Climate Policy Mechanisms.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a> These recommendations based on the thematic areas where then formulated into a list of prioritization based on their prominence. This then was to be presented at COP 15 with the hope that representatives and politicians will note the public\u2019s thoughts on global climate issues and consider it when creating a plan of action.</p><p><strong>INFLUENCE, OUTCOME, AND EFFECTS</strong></p><p>One of the main goals for the directors and creators of these conferences around the world was to introduce the well-functioning citizen participation in deliberation. As the official website of the organization states, \u201cThe idea was to introduce citizen participation, which is normally used only as a national tool, on a global level.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a> Of course the main purpose for the meetings was to influence the COP15 negotiations and to see a future plan of action for resolving the issues on global climate. But also to demonstrate that decision-making regarding politics or any other national or global topics and issues can see great influential results by involving the participation of citizens from society. Without a doubt a great influence was seen after the conferences came to an end. Not only did it help to bring great and vital awareness to climate change in a global to individual state but also it set the frameworks for wide scale global deliberations and how it can be achieved with great and successful outcomes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the actual outcomes of what to do regarding climate change and to COP15, the results for each conference all agree with what should be done. The creators of this organization were surprised as to how consistent the results were across national income groups and geographical regions.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a> The main and most clear message that citizens send to their politicians is for them to take fast and strong action at COP15. Citizens had their voices heard but they also want their voices to have a purpose. The citizens at the meetings all agreed on these results:</p><ol><li>They call for long-term global average temperature targets of less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels</li><li>Higher reduction targets than what their politicians at COP15 have proposed</li><li>They call for fair and proportionate burden sharing so bigger advance nations would carry the heaviest load and so on</li><li>Countries who do no meet with their required commitment will face punishment</li><li>The need for technological development and distribution is a requirement for results to happen</li><li>\u00a0The need for international institutions to advance the objectives of a new climate deal.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a></li></ol><p>The Danish Board of Technology divided the impact of the conferences into two categories. There is the Climate Category and the Democracy Category.\u00a0 The Danish Board of Technology states that the results of the global conference were publicized visually in the cityscape of Copenhagen.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a> The main reasoning behind this was for the COP15 delegates to have heard the main conclusions that came out of the deliberations. Luckily for the WWViews they had a strong supporter behind them, Ms. Connie Hedegaard, who is the Danish Minister of Climate and the COP15 host. One of the main results that came out of the conferences was the large media coverage that it received. As the Danish Board of Technology states that the coverage included that of international newspapers, televisions, and the Internet, which in return would reach the ears and eyes of the decision makers, stake-holders, and politicians and bring even more awareness to climate issues. One of the main and more valuable outcomes that came from this project is the data set that was created. This will allow for better understanding of what a wide variety of citizens around the globe think of climate change and how it should be dealt with.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is also the Democracy Category, which praises what this project has done for the future of citizen participation and deliberation. The Danish Board of Technology states that this has demonstrated and established \u201cpublic participation in nations around the world.\u201d It has created \u201can enduring network of institutions and trained project managers able to conduct future WWViews projects on other issues.\u201d It has also conducted \u201ca cross-cultural experiment in complex, Internet-mediated cooperative relations between institutions.\u201d</p><p><strong>ANALYSIS AND CRITICISM</strong></p><p>A project of such global scale has gotten much praised for its great strides in getting normal citizens participating on issues that affects them all and having their voices heard by politicians around the world. But with great success also came criticism.</p><p>\u00a0In the article \u201cFacing the micro/macro dilemma: The World Wide Views on Global Warming as a transnational mini-public,\u201d by Julien Talpin states that even though the project and the meeting did a good job in uniting individual voices, the voices were not able to pass that of the micro level. Talpin also states that just as many other citizens driven deliberation projects face, the results were \u201conly marginally taken into consideration by elected officials.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a> Thus at the end, he analyses that unfortunately the gap between the public\u2019s opinions and that of the elected representatives was not overcome as it was expected. He states that the reasoning behind this might have been that some proposals were accepted and other rejected mainly because they were inconsistent with what elected officials stand for. Talpin sees this experiment as a wake up call for future deliberations made by citizens. He states \u201cmicro and macro deliberation appears in any case as one of the greatest challenge it faces nowadays. If it fails to answer it, deliberative democracy might remain a marginal phenomenon, or worst delude citizens as having no significant impact on their lives.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a></p><p>We should view the analysis and criticism of this experimental project as both a failure and success. As this project being the first of its kind, we should not be surprised that the end results may have not been what expected. It is a project of grand scale that could not have gone without some sort of failure. Also the end results had to reach aggressive politicians from around the world who may or may not share the views of what came out of the conferences. \u201cYes!\u201d Magazine, which focuses on powerful ideas becoming practical actions, praises the project. They are astounded by the results that came out of the conferences. In the article \u201cWorld\u2019s Citizens to Politicians: Get Serious on Global Warming Now!\u201d they praise the project for getting citizens who come from low income society to take a stand and let their voice be heard since they are most likely to suffer some of the worst consequences regarding global climate change. Connie Hedegaard is quoted in the article stating, \u201cWorld Wide Views has given us politicians a unique insight into the views of ordinary citizens from all corners of the world on the climate crisis\u2026. It is a powerful signal to the politicians when citizens all over the world agree that actions is urgent.\u201d Yet the article still points out contradictory actions from politicians after the meetings. After the conferences a new Pew poll found that Americans were still not that concern with global warming.<a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref11\">[11]</a> Also the New York Times states that the chance for producing a new climate change treaty at the UN summit in Copenhagen is less likely to occur. Yet the article still praises the conferences for many reasons.\u00a0 They praise the project because they believe that instead of just getting opinions we received \u201ccarefully considered judgment.\u201d They believe that the results that came from the conferences is more of a prototype of what is be the judgment of people around the world on climate change as this topic garners a more prominent stand on global issues. Yes! Magazine states that \u201chumanity as begun to find its voice. The next step is for all of us to pitch in and amplify that voice\u201d so that we can ensure that politicians and negotiators that the voices from the public are informed and reflect what is best for humanity and what we want our leaders to do. <a href=\"#_ftn12\" name=\"_ftnref12\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref12\">[12]</a></p><p>What this project has done is created the foundations and frameworks for possible democratic procedures to be conducted on a global scale in the future. It has been established that deliberation such as this is possible. It is only the beginning of what will surely be a future of democratic meetings around the world, allowing for well-informed citizens to take tremendous care for the path that our globe will take.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>SECONDARY SOURCES</strong></p><p>World Wide Views on Global Warming</p><p><strong><a

Democracy Project for Civic Engagement is a national, multi-campus initiative that seeks to foster informed civic engagement in the United States. The project seeks to create a greater intellectual understanding and commitment to participate in the civic life of the United States.</p><p>Focused on undergraduates at public colleges and universities, the American Democracy Project has created a collaborative network of 199 public colleges and universities, representing more than 1.7 million students, that are member institutions of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). The three-year project, sponsored by AASCU in collaboration with The New York Times, will provide opportunities for participating campuses to engage in activities and projects designed to increase the number of undergraduate students committed to meaningful civic actions.\" *</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3>Participants include over 250 colleges and universities who are members of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). Forty-seven states (except Hawaii, Idaho, and Wyoming) plus the District of Columbia are represented by participants in the ADP. \u00a0In order to become a member of the ADP, the campus must be members of the AASCU. Potential members must also apply for membership with a letter of interest submitted by the university\u2019s president to the National Manager of the ADP, Jennifer Domagal-Goldman. The benefits and opportunities stemming from involvement with the ADP are incredibly helpful to the students- and there is no membership fee for either student or institution. The ADP seeks to conduct conferences and meetings to better the policies and educational resources to students across the nation. <br /><br />The ADP is a collaboration with the New York Times. It is partnered with the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University, the Center for Democracy and Citizenship, the Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne University, CIRCLE, Epsilen, the National Conference on Citizenship, the New England Resource Center for Higher Education, Public Agenda, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, The Democracy Commitment, and the Yellowstone Association.<h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The American Association of State Colleges and Universities, \u201cholds an annual meeting, sponsors seven national civic engagement initiatives and provides a national platform for AASCU faculty, staff, and students to foster informed, engaged citizens for our democracy.\u201d ** <br /><br />Special Days in Action: The ADP participates in days of action during several days per year. These are holidays emphasizing civil action, including holidays such as Earth Day, 9/11, and MLK Day. </p><ul><li>For example, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the American Democracy Project collaborated on Tennessee\u2019s largest naturalization ceremony in celebration of Constitution Day in 2012. Three hundred people took an oath of national allegiance to the United States of America on the 225th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. </li></ul><p>Civic Engagement in Action Series: The Civic Engagement in Action Series are nationwide and campus-wide activities for undergraduates to promote civic engagement. The series focus on national issues and examine American problems and conflicts. </p><ul><li>America\u2019s Future: Protecting the Fiscal Health of Our Democracy</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The objective is to give undergraduates an awareness about America\u2019s current fiscal situation, educate them about the financial future and assist them (and policy makers) in order to develop solutions that will end, or at least lower, the national debt and deficit. This is important because students need to be aware of the increasing rise of both federal debt and deficit since 1980, and the effects America\u2019s fiscal situation will have on future generations. </p><ul><li>Campus and Community Civic Health Initiative</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The objective is to find ways to assess both campus and community civic health, and develop a program to improve the assessed health. It also plans to determine how college/university campuses support community civic health. Civic health includes involvement in community groups, discussion of politics, discussing local issues, volunteering, service activities, and political action. This was started in June, 2012 as an effort to improve both campus and community civic health. This is a signature program for the ADP\u2019s 10th anniversary in partnership with the National Confederation on Citizenship. </p><ul><li>Civic Agency</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The objective is for all citizens, no matter their financial statuses, ethnicities, religions, or geography, to come together and develop the idea of a civic agency. Civic agency is a set of skills needed for collective action. The intent is to change civic decline into centers of civic renewal. This initiative is in partnership with the Center for Democracy and Citizenship. </p><ul><li>Deliberative Polling\u00ae</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The objective is a multiple part process where campus subjects are tested through \u201cDeliberative Polling\u201d strategies on public issues. The first part includes a random, representative sampling that polls specific public interest topics. Some members of the sample are then invited to deliberate the issue in a public forum, then after the discussion, are asked the original question. Changes of opinion illustrate opinions based on true deliberation and information. Practices created from the Deliberative Polling tests are then used to educate undergraduate students about these issues. This will promote active members of society once these students earn their degree. </p><ul><li>eCitizenship: New Tools, New Strategies, New Spaces</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The objective is to determine how our democracy is transformed by technology, and to educate students about this technology. Strategies are created to teach students about using social media for a \u201ccivic purpose.\u201d eCitizenship recognizes the increasing importance of technological tools like blogs, Facebook, or wikis. This is a three year initiative partnered with the Center for the Study of Citizenship at Wayne State University and thirty-five institutions. A sub-initiative is the Informed Citizen Project.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><u>Informed Citizen Project:</u> This is centered on ADP\u2019s civic participation on the World Wide Web. Undergraduates need to be critical of the media and information consumed from that environment. It seeks to develop media and information literacy in regards to civic engagement, and create new programs in college-level media for graduates to be engaged citizens. \u00a0 </p><ul><li>Global Engagement Initiative</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The objective is to both identify and analyze long-term policies regarding population, resource management, technology, information, economic integration, conflict and security, and governance. It is the only international initiative in the ADP, seeking to educate students about global challenges, and how to make informed judgments. It is partnered with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. </p><ul><li>Stewardship of Public Lands</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">The objective is to educate participants (faculty members) on the history and science of controversies in public lands, especially Yellowstone National Park. These faculty members will then return to their colleges and universities, where they will develop programs for their students regarding Yellowstone or local public lands. Public lands, such as national parks, throughout the US are sources of contention over ownership rights, environmental issues, potential sources of energy, and general use of land. This is in collaboration with the Yellowstone Association, which supports the preservation of the national park. </p><ul><li>Political Engagement Project\u00a0</li></ul><p>\u200bThe objective is to teach students about politics, public policy, and how to become involved in nonpartisan issues. Through this project, undergraduates should develop skills useful in democratic participation, taught in non-partisan and non-ideological environments. The Political Engagement Project emphasizes the importance of involvement in both political and nonpolitical activities. </p>\u00a0<h3>Meeting Process</h3>The American Democracy Project engages and several different forms of meetings throughout the year. Some of the meetings are annual, while others are conducted more in a conference style focusing in either one specific area or in accordance with one college specifically. The annual meeting typically occurs in October, gives a chance for a larger group of contributors to discuss national issues and take steps toward establishing leadership. Also, once a year, the ADP and The Democracy Commitment meet to convene and discuss their goals for the following year. The American Democracy Project also hosts individual meetings and conferences across the nation throughout the year. <ul><li>2012 Annual Meeting began place on October 29, 2012 and lasted until October 31, 2012 at The Roosevelt in New Orleans, Louisiana. The theme of this year\u2019s event was \u201cAddressing the American Challenge\u201d The meeting focused on addressing the challenge of providing transformational leadership for colleges and universities to help better the achievement gap among students. The 2013 Annual meeting has been set for October 21-23, but the location and general agenda have yet to be announced. </li><li>American Democracy Project/ The Democracy Commitment 2013 National Meeting will take place June 6, 2013- June 8, 2013. This will be their third annual meeting. The theme of the meeting, 21st Century Citizens: Building Bridges, Solving Problems, focuses on, \u201ceducational experiences and civic skills needed by today\u2019s graduates.\u201d These experiences and skills are necessary for both civic engagement and in the workforce. More than 500 attendees are expected which will include college and university administrators, students, community members, and faculty members. The ADP/ TDC National Meeting will have sessions where topics such as global citizenship, political engagement, 21st century citizenship skills, and service-learning are discussed. These sessions will be in the format of lightning rounds, poster presentations, round table discussions, concurrent presentations, workshops, and panels.</li><li>Council of State Representatives (CSR) took place from March 21 to March 23 in 2012 in the nation\u2019s capitol of Washington D.C. In attendance was the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) Council of Representatives. Representatives from all 50 states were present and the goal is to advocate for higher education policies for the AASCU institutions. </li><li>2012 Academic Affairs Summer Meeting was held in San Francisco, California from July 26 to July 28. The meeting was expected to \u201cfocus on the critical tools and elements that are necessary to create a 21st century institution... examining issues such as data analytics, \u2026 working with for-profit providers, \u2026 models for campus-wide internationalization\u201d *** </li></ul><h3>Influence, Outcome, and Effects</h3><ul><li>The Democracy Commitment is modeled after the American Democracy Project. Unlike the ADP, it focuses on community colleges throughout the nation. This is to create an awareness for community college students about civic learning, and to foster a participation in democracy. </li><li>Film Your Issue is partnered with the ADP. This is a contest for home filmmakers to create a video about issues important to them. </li></ul>Secondary Sources<br /><a href=\"http://www.aascu.org/programs/ADP/\">http://www.aascu.org/programs/ADP/</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.fhsu.edu/adp/\">http://www.fhsu.edu/adp/</a><br /><a href=\"http://americandemocracy.illinoisstate.edu/\">http://americandemocracy.illinoisstate.edu/</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.gcsu.edu/adp/index.htm\">http://www.gcsu.edu/adp/index.htm</a> <br /><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial2/coll_aascu_mission.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial2/coll_aascu_mission.html</a> <br /><a href=\"http://adpaascu.wordpress.com/\">http://adpaascu.wordpress.com/</a> <br /><a href=\"http://www.mtsusidelines.com/mtsu-to-play-host-to-states-largest-naturalization-ceremony/\">http://www.mtsusidelines.com/mtsu-to-play-host-to-states-largest-naturalization-ceremony/</a> <br /><a href=\"http://adpaascu.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/adp-ncoc-campus-community-civic-health-initiative_description.pdf\">http://adpaascu.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/adp-ncoc-campus-community-civic-health-initiative_description.pdf</a> <br />\u00a0External Links<br /><a href=\"http://www.filmyourissue.com\">www.filmyourissue.com</a> <p>Notes</p><p>* The mission statement is taken from The New York Times.

Its focus lays in building leadership within smaller community to advance social change. The group supports individual, institutional, and community advancements to improve issues on inequality and injustice through its programs.</p><p>The CEL has strived to maintain its status as one of many organizations that encourage societal involvement and promote parity within the United States for twenty years. Its main office is currently located in Seattle, Washington and they are operating few programs such as Gracious Space, Community Learning Exchange, and Nourishing Networks. Following its foundational values, the programs continue to motivate people to engage in greater interests of the society by educating them.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Dr. Bill Grace, the founder of CEL began his first social justice actions at an early age and earned a doctoral degree by researching how people utilize their personal passion into taking civil actions. During his doctoral research, he encountered a girl who shared her personal experience of how she became a social activist herself. She explained how her experience as a child - as Dr. Grace did \u2013 affected her most in shaping her motivation in leading desegregation in Puget Sound schools.</p><p>This greatly enlightened him that raising awareness should begin from the younger generation so he became an educator. He developed the 4-V model which is the keystone of the Center and serves as a guideline for its leaders to place Values, Vision, and courage to critique as their top priorities.</p><p>When CEL was finally founded in 1991, Dr. Grace stated that it was founded to be a \u201ccatalyst for creating a just society.\u201d While most early leadership organizations in the United States during the early nineties promoted a leadership development model which focused at individual level, Dr. Grace distinguished his center by adding on a different principle of advancing leadership at a group level.</p><p>The Center enjoyed its quick expansion throughout nation in its early stage through a strong partnership with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Since its establishment, the Center has been dedicated in practicing the rudimentary concepts of Collective Leadership and frameworks for community advancements. Its effort still lay in fostering creative ways to promote harmony of diverse groups of people within a community.</p><p>In 2005, Dr. Bill Grace has stepped down from the Executive Director role and is currently continuing his social work through teaching.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Mission and Purpose</strong></p><p>The purpose of CEL is to direct local communities in a better direction by sharing its core values with the community members in order to cultivate leaders. CEL has worked with various local communities beyond boundaries and ever since it was founded it has worked with more than 15,000 participants from 30 different states. Its mission and purposes are clarified by defining Ethical Leadership, the 4-V Model, and Collective Leadership.</p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Ethical Leadership </strong></li></ul><p>The most basic definition the Center offers for Ethical Leadership is \u201cknowing your core values and having the courage to live them in all parts of your life in service of the common good\u201d.</p><p>A list of insightful questions that may help one to strive toward achieving higher level of Ethical Leadership is listed here:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you be the same person at work? At home? In the community?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you have the courage to live out your values when there is pressure to compromise or rationalize?</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do your values contribute to the common good?</p><p><strong>The 4-V Model</strong></p><p>The diagram below is what Dr. Grace calls the 4-V model.\u00a0</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ethicalleadership.org/about-us/our-story/4-v-model/image_mini\" /></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Value</strong>, which is located at the top of the triangle, is what the leaders should base their actions on. Not only do they have to firmly believe in their core ethics, but also they have to commit to them by beginning to modify their daily lives at home and/or at work. Dr. Grace regards this as the integration of both the external and internal values that actually produce an outcome.</p><p><strong>Vision </strong>enables the leaders to widen their perspectives and \u201cframe\u201d their services. This incorporates the ability to predict how their actions can potentially affect their community in what specific ways. Dr. Grace argues it is crucial for a leader to truly know him or herself because without a thorough self-reflection, it will be virtually impossible to have a vision for a greater entity.</p><p><strong>Voice </strong>is the instrument that is necessary to pronounce the visions of the leaders. They need to persuade the public with a rhetoric that is appealing and convincing, but also with credibility. Dr. Grace explains that this is a part of \u201cfinding one\u2019s voice\u201d to express and deliver their ideas and visions more effectively. It is useful to confirm coherence frequently between Vision and Values because it is possible that the Voice could alter the original intent.</p><p><strong>Virtue </strong>is located at the center of the model because it is fundamentally another name for Ethical Leadership. Doing what is considered as right and good is clearly part of this component nevertheless this is the overarching glue that binds the former three V\u2019s. The virtuous character, also known as integrity, cannot be attained without transforming one\u2019s values into actions or without an ultimate goal for the entire group. It is suggested that the leaders ask themselves <em>\u201cHow are my values, vision and voice keeping up with the common good?\u201d</em></p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Collective Leadership</strong></li></ul><h3>The official website of CEL defines Collective Leadership\u00a0as \u201ca way for diverse groups of people in our communities to hold purpose, direction, and action cooperatively\u201d.</h3><p>The Center supports individual, institutional, and public transformations based on the desire to create a more healthy and inclusive society. The Center emphasizes Collective Leadership from each community member and encourages expanding the individualistic perspective of \u201cI\u201d to a wider angle that is geared toward \u201cWe\u201d. And it stresses the potential power \u201cwe\u201d create is stronger than an individual one. Consequently Collective Leadership maintains equality by decreasing the distinction between \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cI.\u201d Collective Leadership includes willingness to listen to anyone who wants to contribute to the society even if that means they have opposing points of view. It advocates sharing ideas and valuing them because any single idea could be fostered into a stimulant that can possibly bring forth changes. Also, Collective Leadership encourages people to use their individual talents for the betterment of the bigger group. According to <em><u>The Collective Leadership Storybook: Weaving Strong Communities</u></em>, the four common patterns that define and facilitate a new form of social chemistry and Collective Leadership are as followed:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We take time to form deep relationships with each other.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We cross boundaries that keep us from working with other who share our purpose.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We trust community wisdom and tap into it to find the answers it holds.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We know our story and together imagine the narrative for our community.</p><p>\u00a0<strong>Additional concepts</strong></p><p>Service, Polis, and Renewal are three additional key factors that contribute in developing quality Ethical Leadership.</p><p><strong>Service </strong>is the bridge between Vision and Values because a true, selfless Vision is to be discovered only after providing service that support one\u2019s Values.</p><p><strong>Polis</strong> is a Greek work that means city and it constitutes the English word <em>politics</em>. And this is the product of a leader doing the work of articulating the Vision with a Voice in a public context.</p><p><strong>Renewal</strong> is considered as the last step that takes places while Voice transforming into Values. This is when the works done by a leader actually renews or modify the society\u2019s original state as a result of Polis.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Programs</strong></p><p>The Center has created different types of programs throughout the years including The Confluence (1999-2006), Kellogg Leadership for Community Change (2002), and Youth Leaders of Promise as one of its earliest launching programs. And since 2005, Bill Grace Leadership Award has been given to those citizens who lead the Puget Sound area of Washington with focus on social, environmental, and economic justice. There are several events throughout the year that take in forms of conferences, training courses, and open-conversation sessions. Currently the Center is offering following programs:</p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>Community Learning Exchange (CLE)</li></ul><p>The goal of CLE is to foster mutual support for diverse groups of people through sharing diverse perspectives of people with various backgrounds. The CLE program was first established by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in 2002 and the major contribution of the program comes from sharing knowledge amongst the local citizens while creating personal connections. The program also focuses on school improvements and boosting the high school graduation rate of African Americans in the area. This program provides resources such as 3-day programs and weekly podcasts online.</p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>Gracious Space</li></ul><p>This program is interesting because one of the Center\u2019s publications is named after this program, hence it can be said that this program is an influential portion of what the Center stands for. The Center offers a description of the program as \u201ca simple yet powerful approach\u201d which sets an atmosphere where they invite \u201cstrangers\u201d to cooperatively solve problems without biases and judgments. The purpose of Gracious Space is to teach the general concept of safe environment for communication among the local citizens. This program creates an environment for the group members to invite more strangers for more active communication and to discuss what they have learned on specific local issues to arrive at best solutions. The coaching sessions are available every quarter in Seattle area or through personal appointments.</p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>Nourishing Networks</li></ul><p>The goal of Nourishing Network is to ease hunger in local communities. The organization\u2019s website says, \u201cGive a man a fish; you have fed him for today. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for a lifetime\u201d. This nourishing network concentrates on supporting locally-owned solutions to fill out the existing economical gaps that leave people hungry and provide them with the skills, tools, and resources to sustain themselves. The Center believes that the solution to hunger and nutrition lay in localized networks and that it can be solved if people collaborate. Community members can participate by contacting the program coordinator directly or registering through the blog. Currently, this program is implemented in these areas in Washington State:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 North Shore</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kirkland</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Issaquah</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lake Washington School District</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Redmond</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bellevue</p><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li>Convening &amp; Dialogue</li></ul><p>The Center provides Convening &amp; Dialogues program for deliberation of local members on specific local issues. The Center believes that through the dialogue, it can create conditions for both personal and collective transformations. The program designed and implemented hundreds of gatherings across the country. Through this program, the Center helps people and groups to address complex social issues such as poverty, racial, and educational inequality.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Participant Selection and Deliberation Process of Programs</strong></p><p>CEL accepts every type of people as participants within the local area regardless of their racial, age, or educational differences to further advance similar goals for the greater good of the community. The program participants are able to simply call the program coordinator and then they are asked to fill out a short survey about personal values and behaviors. The survey does not ask for the participant\u2019s demographics because they do not select participants by any discriminating means. In so doing, the Center intends on becoming a deliberative organization by advancing one of the criteria of democratic process by respecting any person. It also promotes analytic rigor through the internal journey Dr. Grace endorses. It allows the participants to examine underlying values, which is the very top of the 4-V Model. Lastly, throughout the Center\u2019s programs, the citizens volunteer to evolve as more qualified leaders.</p><p>Especially the Community Learning Exchange is very deliberative in that the participants are educated for three days. First the Center teaches the concept of Gracious Space, core values of center, and what activities they are engaged in to create better way for local community. After that, Center\u2019s committee members ask participants compelling questions regarding sensitive issues that their local communities are facing. After each participant has enough time to reflect on the issues, they discuss it together. Throughout the discussion, participants first cultivate relationship and are asked to open up to think about local issues in new ways as. The Center suggests various ways to improve their local community life. \u00a0</p><p><strong>Public interaction and Publications</strong></p><p>In general, the Center makes efforts in publishing free downloads available online for extra resources besides the publications for purchase. They are assimilating to the new technological mediums such as the tablet PCs and e-reader softwares, which is a way to cater to broader public. They have online forums and weekly podcasts that are broadcasted but the online forums are the more important factor because this is where they give space to the public to openly criticize the Center and its activities. Some of the publications that are currently on sale are:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><u>The Collective Leadership Storybook: Weaving Strong Communities</u></p><p>This book describes the key values of working together that encourage Collective Leadership.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><u>Courageous Collaboration with Gracious Space</u></p><p>In the midst of this rapid changing and increasing diversity within communities and organization, the Center published this book to encourage collaborations as providing frameworks of the Gracious Space.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><u>Gracious Space</u></p><p>The Center not only provides programs of Gracious Space, but also published this particular book with more rigid understandings of Gracious Space. This book explains what Gracious Space is, how it can be used, and how to create it in your community and work place.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><u>Ethical Leadership: In pursuit of the common good</u></p><p>This book is a biography of the founder, Bill Grace, and describes the key values he has developed.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And <u>Kellogg Leadership for Community Change: Crossing Boundaries Strength Communities</u></p><p>This book focuses on more in-depth concept of Collective Leadership, community change, social advocacy and evaluation.</p><p><strong>Analysis of Influences and Outcomes</strong></p><p>The Center seems as though it is an organization operating in an ideal circumstance and has been appraised for creating fair and safe communicating space for the general public. The CEL program was also successful with raising high school graduation rate and assisting spreading the concept of Ethical Leadership in various states such as Montana, New York Texas, and Minnesota. There was a report from Texas that student participants of Gracious Space and CLE were more aptly prepared to enter higher education including Ivy League institutions. There was statistics from Minnesota that the graduation rate of Native American students in public high schools jumped from 18% to 50% after participating in CEL\u2019s programs. Similarly the African American youth population in Michigan graduated with the rate of little over 60%. Additionally, Gracious Space members successfully passed an initiative that created a $133 million-funding to build new schools in the low-income areas of Hispanic communities in Southern Texas.</p><p>It is worthwhile to note that the presence of the Center in these areas directly or indirectly influenced these rates. It has been reported that the public compliments that the Center provides networking opportunities between the White community and the minorities as well especially throughout the discussions.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Center works effectively to improve some of these social issues drastically but it has limitations in that it is a non-profit organization, thus it lacks support to fund enough scholarships at times. Nonetheless this problem is yet to be solved for any non-profit organization around the world.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Secondary Sources </strong></p><p>Dale Nienow, Roger Erskine, Melissa Hamsaki, ed. \u201cThe Center for Ethical Leadership Project Annual Report\u201d. <em>The Center for Ethical Leadership</em>. 2008.

In addition, it has some of the lowest civic engagement rates in the nation. \u201c Nationwide, California is ranked among the bottom five in voter registration rates and 46th in the percentage of people who talk about politics with their family and friends a few times a week or more\u201d (Zocal Public Square). Civic engagement is an ongoing issue in California, specifically in the lens of the large political engagement issue when it comes to voting and voter registration. Another area where it is lacking is in social civic engagement such as in volunteering and in speaking with others about politics. What may account for this is that there is found to be an inverse relationship between levels of ethnic diversity and civic engagement according to Sociologist Robert Putnam in his study called \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d. Michael Alvarez, a political scientist at the California Institute of Technology claims that there is a social disconnect fueled by the size, population, and diversity of the state which affects the ability of citizens to be connected.</p><p>The Davenport Institution for Public Engagement and Civic Leadership at Pepperdine University works to engage the citizens of California in the policy decisions that affect their everyday lives to ultimately help solve California\u2019s public problems. They believe that the states municipal and education leaders are seeking ways to involve the residents of their communities in the important issues they confront (Davenport Institute). Thus, this produces more creative policy solutions and encourages the citizens to be more engaged and committed to the work of self-governance. They work with governments, special districts, regional governance associations, and non-profit organizations to support and promote this civic engagement.</p><p>The institute works with city governments, school districts, and civic organizations in three ways. First, it serves as a matchmaker and consultant between municipalities and professional firms. This is how it is able to connect creative leaders with others who might be looking for a local solution to the particular policy issue. Secondly, it acts as a sponsor working directly and indirectly to support citizen engagement projects financially by dedicating a substantial portion of their annual budget to grant-making. The Davenport Institute offers communities financial support up to $25,000 to carry out legitimate engagement projects through their Public Engagement Grant Program. They also bring in outside funding. The third way is by the institute serving as a promoter and advocate for the process of civic engagement through speeches, op-eds, and other opportunities like the \u201cA Place in the World\u201d conference hosted with the Pepperdine School of Public Policy. The Executive Director or Board Members are also available and can be contacted to speak about citizen engagement in the community\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The Davenport Institute was formerly known as Common Sense California. It was founded as a multi-partisan and non-profit organization in 2005.\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The institute created a half day training seminar where participants learn the \u201cCivic Engagement Spectrum\u201d; from informing to involving residents, when your city, region, or school district is ready to engage the public, how to develop a positive engagement campaign, important attitude and behavior changes for elected officials, staff, and residents. Lastly, they will learn the five main criteria for judging an effective civic engagement process.</p><p>For this particular event people who should attend are city staff (City Managers, Planners, etc.) elected officials (Mayors, Council Members), school district leaders (Supes, School Board Members), county/regional officials and staff. \u00a0The purpose of this event is to promote public involvement on important decisions that can lead to solutions when managed effectively.</p><p>The institute also hosts conferences such as the \u201cDeliberative Democracy in America\u201d which took place on February 23-24th, 2007. It was an opportunity to explore important ways of furthering democracy in California. It was co-hosted with the Pepperdine University School of Public Policy, with the sponsorship by New America Foundation. Those who attended the conference heard from experts and practitioners about deliberative democracy. Leaders of social, cultural, business, nonprofit, and political systems in the state spoke on how they believe tools of deliberative democracy might be useful in California, and what limitations or challenges they observe. \u00a0On the second day of the conference, they carried out a deliberative exercise that would consider several specific approaches they could take in California.</p><p>Davenport has several blogs where citizens can get involved in talking about local issues. In Common is the institutes' Participatory Governance Blog where people can find information about the latest resources, studies, programs, and discussions about Civic Engagement in California, nationwide, and globally. Golden Governance is a joint project between the Davenport Institute and the National Conference on Citizenship (NCoC). Here cities, towns, and counties across the state can rethink about how to approach some of their challenges with the help of public participation. This is a space where local leaders and members of the community are able to share their success stories and work together to provide services and solve problems. The blog Big Society Watch keeps readers up to date on the highlights of the ideas, programs, and controversies about British Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s \u201cBig Society\u201d agenda which includes his plan to de-centralize\u00a0 services to the local level of government and how this can be related back to civic engagement and local government programs in the United States. The last blog is called Government 2.0 Watch. It offers information relating to how governments around the world use social media, mobile apps, and other technological innovations to interact with their residents</p><p>The Davenport Institute also participates in state public engagement projects on multiple government levels; citywide, regional, and statewide projects. They cover a wide range of categories including budget and service prioritization, healthcare policy, participatory budgeting, housing, land use, and transportation. In 2009, for instance, they worked on a project concerning Santa Cruz Online Budgeting. At this time Santa Cruz was \u201cfaced with a $9.2MM budget deficit\u201d (Public Policy Pepperdine). Dick Wilson, City Manager, worked alongside Peter Koht, his Economic Development Coordinator to come up with a way to engage the public. The result was the creation of a \u201cBudget Crisis\u201d website which allowed citizens to voice budget reduction suggestions that could \u201cbe voted up or down by fellow citizens\u201d.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcome, and Effects</h3><p>The institute believed that the \u201cDeliberative Democracy in America\u201d conference led to a greater understanding of deliberative democracy by both policy makers and opinion leaders in California. In the recent years, they have witnessed a growth in \u201cparticipatory budgeting\u201d efforts and municipalities attempting to do the same. Many other cities are considering projects like these. \u00a0The Davenport Institute conducted the 2008 Citizen Engagement Grant Program. They offered financial aid and consultative support to cities and school districts for legitimate engagement efforts. In three months, they received over 70 submissions from around the state for civic engagement project on subjects ranging from budgeting to school district visioning.</p><p>The Santa Cruz Online Budgeting project was said to be a \u201csuccess in engaging the public\u201d because they received many suggestions. According to the summary, however, only \u201c8% of the city population participated\u201d. In the end 48 positions were cut to reduce costs.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>The events and the outcomes of the numerous projects taken on by the Davenport Institute there is seemingly a lack in participation by regular citizens of the community. Those who are participating, who are invested in coming up with solutions, and becoming engaged tend to be former elected officials, local activists, and city officials. Much of this is due to the fact that the conferences and trainings put on by the organization are largely targeted at these particular demographics.</p><p>Ultimately, the institute succeeds in creating opportunities for local leaders to learn about civic engagement and at educating them on how to outreach to residents of their own communities to get them involved in political deliberation. In this sense, the institute mostly influences the participation of regular citizens on California issues indirectly.\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>James Irvine Foundation\u2019s California Democracy Program</p><p>W.K.

Its mission is making the informed voice of everyday citizens heard \u2014 and making sure elected officials and politicians address the issues.</p><p>Jefferson Action is the 501(c)(4) partner of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/organizations/jefferson-center\">the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Processes.</a></p><h3>History</h3><p>In 1974, Minneapolis native Ned Crosby founded a think tank called <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/organizations/jefferson-center\">the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Processes,</a> Jefferson Action's partner organization. Named in honor of Thomas Jefferson, who believed that the American people are the ultimate source of power in our democracy \u2013 and that they will make the right decisions if they\u2019re educated on the issues. The Jefferson Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, whereas Jefferson Action is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit.</p><p>In 2003, Ned founded Jefferson Action to take a more active role in holding politicians accountable to the people. Using the Citizens Jury method, Jefferson Action holds Citizen Election Forums to develop specific policy recommendations and ensure that politicians and candidates respond the important issues their constituents have identified.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>In 2012, Jefferson Action embarked on an ambitious project to influence the conversation in a hotly contested congressional race. The project, named Reclaim November, used the Citizen Election Forum to evaluate Congressional candidates in Northeast Ohio. Due to redistricting, two incumbent members of Congress were pitted against each other in Ohio's 16th Congressional District, Betty Sutton (D) and Jim Renacci (R).</p><p>Jefferson Action partnered with community groups, the media and academic institutions to hold three Citizen Election Forums in Ohio's 16th Congressional District. Each forum brought together 24 citizens randomly selected from the district assuring a demographically representative sample. These citizens studied the complexities of the economic issues facing the people of Ohio and evaluated the candidates responsiveness to addressing those issues.</p><p>Both Jim Renacci and Betty Sutton agreed to participate in the forum. After spending more than an hour talking to each of the candidates, the Forum participants issued an evaluation of the solutions the Representatives presented on the economic issue troubling Northeast Ohio.</p><p>The project received significant media attention, <a href=\"http://jeffersonaction.org/category/news-coverage/\">with more than 80 news stories in four months, including a dozen front page articles in the districts two most influential papers.</a> The Reclaim November Ohio project also had a significant impact on the vote. Internal polling done by Jefferson Action showed that as much as 2.5 percent of voters reported the project influenced their vote.

The project calls for heavy community involvement and feedback about issues that are most relevant and important to the Tasmanian community. The plan currently includes 12 goals and 155 benchmarks indicating the most important community issues expressed in deliberative discussions in 2000, 2005, and 2011.[1] These goals and benchmarks are monitored and reported on by a Progress Board, consisting of nine members (although legislation was passed by Parliament in 2012 to repeal the employment of the Progress Board, and instead use government agencies to report progress in an effort to reduce state funding to the plan). The plan also requires the Progress Board to issue reviews and recommendations for any addition, alteration, or deletion of current goals or benchmarks in order to ensure the plan is operating at maximum potential and securing a prosperous future for the Tasmanian community.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Tasmania Together was originally created to placate controversial topics in the community, such as the 1998 decision to reduce the number of parliament seats, the decision to permit gambling machines in hotels and bars in 1997, and a conflict about clear-cutting rainforests.[2] The premise was based on another commission called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Progress_Board\">Oregon Shines</a>, based in the U.S. state of Oregon, which had similar motives to appease conflict by seeking community input.</p><p>The purpose of the Tasmania Together plan is to ensure a harmonious and prosperous society for the state\u2019s collective community. It promotes an open government model, which allows citizens the opportunity to freely participate in decision-making based on their views, ideas, and priorities. The system is meant to be cooperative and innovative as to encourage deliberation among citizens and eventually use their suggestions to create a safe and healthy lifestyle for the community as a whole. The plan currently has 12 goals (listed on its website) it seeks to accomplish by the year 2020, when the project\u2019s initial run is complete:</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A reasonable standard of living for all Tasmanians.</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Confident and safe communities.</p><p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 High quality education and training for lifelong learning and a skilled workforce.</p><p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Active, healthy Tasmanians with access to quality and affordable health care services.</p><p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vibrant, inclusive and growing communities where people feel valued and connected.</p><p>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dynamic, creative and internationally recognized arts community and culture.</p><p>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acknowledgement of the right of Aboriginal people to own and preserve their culture, and share with non-Aboriginal people the richness and value of that culture.</p><p>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Open and accountable government that listens to and plans for a shared future.</p><p>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increased work opportunities for all Tasmanians.</p><p>10.\u00a0 Thriving and innovative industries driven by a high level of business confidence.</p><p>11.\u00a0 Value and protect our biodiversity and natural heritage.\u00a0Sustainable management of our natural resources.[1]</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>In May 1999, Tasmania\u2019s then-Labor Premier Jim Bacon appointed 22 community members from diverse backgrounds to develop a government-funded plan for the state\u2019s future. In July of that year, 60 additional individuals were invited to a three-day conference to research and draft a proposal. The draft was completed at the end of 1999 and sent to 14,000 community members with a request for feedback. A number of deliberative meetings and consultations followed to address comments and criticisms and revise the draft.[2]</p><p>The final draft of the plan was published in October 2000 and included 24 primary goals and 212 benchmarks. In order to oversee, report on, and revise the progress of these goals, the government passed the <em><a href=\"http://www.tasmaniatogether.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/131730/TT_Act1.pdf\">Tasmania Together Progress Board Act 2001</a></em>, which required the employment of a group of citizens to carry out these duties. The act also mandated the plan be reviewed and revised (if necessary) quinquenially by asking citizens about their past, present, and future priorities and if the plan is adept at meeting those priorities.[2]</p><p>A revised plan was published in June 2006 after a number of citizen forums occurred for the first five-year review during 2005 and yielded 12 modified goals and 143 benchmarks. The second five-year review took place in 2010, included over 5,000 citizen participants and yielded a number of key issues to be addressed moving forward while maintaining the core values of the plan. A report on the review and its resulting recommendations was issued to the Tasmanian Parliament in 2011.[2]</p><p>In October 2012, the Tasmanian Parliament enacted legislation to repeal the requirement of a Progress Board to oversee the plan. The <em><a href=\"http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/bills/pdf/48_of_2012.pdf\">Tasmania Together Progress Board Repeal Bill 2012</a></em>, was passed in order to reduce spending. The Progress Board cut was estimated to save an estimated $1.1 million per year in funding, and was instructed to disband after its final meeting in 2012[4]. Resources of the Board will be redirected to support the priorities of the Tasmanian government after it is disbanded. These priorities include data collection, performance reporting, community consultation and community engagement.[4] Projects such as the \u201cStats Matter\u201d project (a joint initiative between the government and the Australian Bureau of Statistics which intends to maximize strategic capacity of data collection) and The Tasmanian Government Framework for Community Engagement (which will assist agencies in effective deliberation with communities) will receive the funding taken from the Board. The Tasmanian government believes disbanding the Board is the best course of action to enhance community engagement.[4]\u00a0The abolition of the Progress Board was met with controversy and concern about the future of the project, with the Tasmania Together chairman suggesting there would no longer be a \u201cspin-free-story\u201d about the plan\u2019s progress and instead be heavily influenced by political agendas.[3]</p><p>The initial run of the project is set to end in 2020.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant selection</h3><p>All Tasmanian citizens are encouraged to participate in deliberative discussions and contribute to the Tasmania Together plan through community surveys and verbal feedback. However, a governing board charged with overseeing the plan was established by the <em><a href=\"http://www.tasmaniatogether.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/131730/TT_Act1.pdf\">Tasmania Together Progress Board Act 2001</a></em>. The act mandated the Progress Board to consist of seven members who represent a broad spectrum of the Tasmanian community. These seven were appointed through public nomination, taking into account a collective balance of gender and regional demographics. Two additional members included a representative from the University of Tasmania and a person appointed to fulfill the requirement of the <em><a href=\"http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/34969/md10.pdf\">State Service Act 2000</a></em>.</p><p>The Progress Board had the power to carry out any administrative functions necessary in order to ensure positive performance and development of the Tasmania Together plan. It was responsible for researching and collecting data about the goals and benchmarks and then monitor and monitor and report on progress toward achieving them. It also is tasked with developing relationships between different community sectors and revising the plan if necessary.</p><p>A bill issued to the Tasmanian Parliament in October 2012, <em><a href=\"http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/bills/pdf/48_of_2012.pdf\">Tasmania Together Progress Board Repeal Bill 2012</a></em>, disbanded the Tasmania Together Progress Board. This legislation was passed in the interest of using its resources to fund other projects and create policy to benefit the Tasmanian community. In passage of the bill, the government ensured the priorities of Tasmania Together would continue to address issues Tasmanian citizens maintained as important.[4]</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, decisions, and public interaction</h3><p>The project has encouraged strong community involvement and feedback since it\u2019s creation. It promotes a by the people, for the people attitude and welcomes any and all positive participation to secure a healthy future for the state. The project is required by law to hold five-year review sessions and adjust goals and benchmarks as necessary to cater to the priorities and interests of the Tasmanian community as a whole.</p><p>Decisions about these adjustments are primarily made through citizen participation. For it\u2019s 10-year review in particular, Tasmania Together held a number of deliberative forums between September and December 2012. This public consultation process saw over 5,000 responses, including 2,178 individual questionaires, 658 online questionairs, 96 written submissions, 1,000 telephone surveys, 1,000 forum attendees, and 334 contributions from students through the <a href=\"http://www.tasmaniatogether.com.au/youth_challenge\">Tasmania Together Youth Challenge</a>.[5]</p><p>With the data collected through the 10-year review forums, the Progress Board evaluated the responses of Tasmanian citizens and developed recommendations for additions, amendments, and deletions of the plan. They made significant changes to the plan\u2019s benchmarks in order to greater suit the needs of the public and ensure consistency. They also reviewed how these revisions could be implemented by 2015 and 2020, respectively.[7] Parliament subsequently approved these revisions.</p><p>Tasmania Together also has a <a href=\"http://www.tasmaniatogether.com.au\">website</a> with information about the project that has been collected since its inception, including previous reviews and revisions of the plan, reports about community involvement, and reports to parliament about the program\u2019s progress. The website also lists a number of ways community members can <a href=\"http://www.tasmaniatogether.com.au/how_to_get_involved\">get involved</a>, such as becoming a partner of the organization (which allows for more authoritative comments on the benchmarks currently under consideration), changes they can make in their own lifestyles (<a href=\"http://www.tasmaniatogether.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/132343/70122_-_Tas_Together_-_51_Ways.pdf\">for which the organization provides an informational pamphlet</a>), and through the Acknowledgement Program (which recognizes people who have made substantial contributions to the community). The organization also has an annual youth challenge for Tasmanians under 20 which challenges participants to investigate and evaluate what is important to them concerning the future of the state.\u00a0. Tasmania Together also has a social media presence on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TasTogether\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/tastogether\">Facebook</a> in order to reach community members of all ages.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, outcome, and effects</h3><p>In 2011, the Progress Board released a pamphlet outlining the outcomes from the 10-year review consultation process, titled <a href=\"http://www.tasmaniatogether.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/147517/TasmaniaTogether_Review_-_what_the_community_said.pdf\">\u201cSpeak Today Shape Tomorrow.\u201d</a> The pamphlet addressed the project\u2019s goals and benchmarks and recognized key themes that were of major concern to the public during the deliberative forums, including financial strain, health services, education, safety, and sustainability. The Progress Board in turn took these issues into consideration and made new recommendations to the Tasmanian Parliament, which were approved in November 2011.[6] The Tasmanian Parliament is not required to take any specific action in implementing new policy based on the recommendations of the Progress Board, but actively endorsed the goals and benchmarks presented in 2011.\u00a0The project is intended to continue to grow and evolve to suit the needs of the Tasmanian community until the end of its initial run in 2020.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and criticism</h3><p>While the project as a whole is mostly recognized as a positive and beneficial model for the Tasmanian community, it has been criticized on occasion for being too broad and, at times, too ambitious. One of the goals of the project is to completely rid the state of poverty by 2020, which may be excessive and unrealistic. There is also no indication or scale of importance dictating what goals need to be achieved with the most haste, leaving those decisions up to governmental policy-makers who are heavily influenced by partisanship.</p><p>The Tasmanian government also heavily funds the project, leaving it susceptible to political bias. While it was necessary for Tasmania Together to initially be funded by the government in order to create a substantial presence and impact, it would be more reasonable moving forward to be run on public support as to prevent partisanship when adopting or adjusting policies. Furthermore, with the repeal of the Progress Board in 2012, there is no oversight to make sure the government is not acting on self-interests, and without these checks and balances, the project will no longer be community-driven.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Bergheim, Stefan. \"Positive Futures - Issue 3.\" <em>Tasmania Together</em>.

This organization wants all Oregonian voices to be heard. Majority of people want to be a part of the decision making process, but don\u2019t know where to start. As well, there are people who know how to share their opinions and take part in the decision making process, but don\u2019t always feel like their voices are being heard. Another one of Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table goals is to resolve these issues and incorporate all Oregon voices into the decision making process. This organization allows for citizens to connect to real decisions in Oregon.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, this organization wants to work with the public to create thorough consultations that don\u2019t have a spin on them. Resulting in creating decisions that reflect what Oregonians really want. The more participation the more decision makers can see how Oregonians think. Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table wants to help identify public priorities in order to make the best decisions. Citizens face tough issues and Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table wants to establish a simple, easy, online, and in person space for Oregon citizens across the state to face these challenges. This is a collaborative problem solving process.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table recognizes that governmental trust is low and that input from everyone is very important. They want to bridge the gap between Oregon citizens and decision makers. \u00a0Overall, as one of the project managers Sarah Giles stated, \u201cOregon\u2019s Kitchen Table wants to increase public interest in participating in public issues at the local, regional, and statewide level.\u201d<br /><br /></p><h3><u>History</u></h3><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Oregon has been working for many years to get citizens involved in public issues, especially after a concerning report that came out in 2010. Phil Keisling, a former secretary of state, stated that, \u201cforty percent of 1.2 million Oregon citizens eighteen to forty were not registered to vote.\u201d This shows how difficult it has become to get basic communication between government and their citizens. Now Oregon is experimenting with a new tool, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table. Originally Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table started off as an experiment in the College of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University, launching on May 4th, 2012. The initial pilot was launched on June 11th 2012 and ran until June 22nd 2012. The first results from the first consultation were posted on August 15th 2012. The remaining results were sent out in three sections every two weeks. This pilot was statewide. After success, they started the second consultation on November 8th 2012 and will run until December 15th 2012. The second consultation was created just for Curry County.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This year is also the ten year anniversary of the partnering of the Policy Consensus Initiative and Portland State University which formed the National Policy Consensus Center. This is where Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table was created.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The name of this organization came from James Geringer. James was a former Wyoming governor and currently is PCI\u2019s (Policy Consensus Initiative) Co-Chair. Geringer stated, \u201cMy background reflects a time when folks would get together to resolve an issue or agree on something by dropping by the house, leaning on the hood of a pickup truck for a chat, or going inside for coffee and a visit around the kitchen table. Typically, when we agreed on a course of action, a handshake or a simple nod sealed the deal. Issues were resolved and commitments were made around the kitchen table.\u201d After this the concept developed, the now called Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table, would be a place to take our dinner conversations and ideas out of the Kitchen and into the public.<br /><br /></p><h3><u>Specializations and activities</u></h3><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table specializes in public issues and the state\u2019s budget plan. Specifically the Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table focuses on helping the governor create Oregon\u2019s ten year plan and the 2013-2015 budget. Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table focuses on certain outcome areas that need to be addressed. In the first consultation there were four outcome areas. Education, healthy people, economy and jobs, and environment issues were discussed in the first consultation. The first consultation was statewide, but the second consultation was specifically for Curry County.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second consultation is addressing the county services and financial problem (revenue shortfall). The main part of Curry County\u2019s economy comes from agriculture and timber/logging. The issue being faced is the county is losing revenue and governmental funding for the timber/ logging industry. This is resulting in a decline in the timber industry and state revenue. Unfortunately, like most places, Oregon and Curry County have been slow to recover from the economic crisis. The county needs to find another way to fund or come up with alternative solutions for increasing revenue and that\u2019s where Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table comes in. The second consultation was created to help solve problems like these.<br /><br /></p><h2><u>How it Works:\u00a0</u></h2><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There are many ways you can contribute to Oregon's Table. The First, take a seat at the table and sign up online. Second, spread the word! Tell your friends about Oregon's Kitchen Table. They need your help reaching out to the community. Also, contact your legislator. Making the legislators aware that this project is important to themselves and their people is a crucial step in making a difference. As well, people can make a donation to Oregon's Kitchen Table. They operate through public and individual funding. Anything helps and they appreciate your support. Lastly, share a photo! Oregon's Kitchen Table has a flicker and facebook page where you can sumbit photos of people at your own kitchen table.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table is both an online and in-person space for Oregon citizens to deliberate and have an impact on the decision making process. There have been two sets of consultations. Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table started off as an experiment. The pilot was statewide and the first consultation was conducted all online. First, the governor and the Department of Administrative Services asked for the public\u2019s opinions and invited them to help prioritize and give input on what they wanted to see happen. This input was for the ten year budget plan and the 2013-2015 budget for Oregon. Next, the advisory board at Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table creates a series of questions that will help reflect the citizen\u2019s opinions and show how they want things prioritized. These are called consultations. The advisory board is made up of highly regarded leaders that represent all communities throughout Oregon. This group is non-partisan, non-profit, and private which gives them a chance to create consultations that are not biased and don\u2019t have a spin on them. The board also provides information to educate the citizens on the issues and decisions that have to be made. Once the advisory board created a consultation they released it to the citizens that signed up to \u201csit down\u201d at Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table. This first consultation was released on June 11th 2012. After that, citizens got a period of time to participate in the online consultation (answering questions, prioritizing, and giving input on what they want to see happen). Once the consultation closed (June 22nd 2012), Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table reviewed the results and made them available for decision makers, media, and the public. The results were sent out in three sections. This gives citizens a chance to fully take in and comment on the results. Additional results were sent out every two weeks. Each results section had two columns of responses. One was the Oregon Kitchen Table members and the other one was the randomly selected representative sample of Oregonians. To make the results more representative of all Oregonians they ran the consultation twice. Once for people who participated in Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table and then they gave it to a random selection of Oregonians. In the end, the governor uses the consultation results and feedback to help make decisions that will represent what Oregon citizens want.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second consultation has been modified slightly. This consultation is not statewide. It was specifically made for Curry County. As well, this consultation is not only online there are opportunities where people can participate in face-to-face deliberation as well online. This consultation was available November 8th 2012 and it will run until December 15th 2012. The rest of the process for this consultation is the same.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through this process Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table helps educates the public and creates a real space for deliberation.<br />\u00a0</p><h2><u>Participation:</u></h2><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Who can participate? Everyone is allowed to participate. They are really looking for Oregon Citizens from all across the state. This way they can collect data from the entire state with a more representative sample. Since Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table is just getting started, the number of participants is on the lower end. Currently 1,614 people have taken a seat at the table (participated in the first consultation). Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table is happy with these numbers, but the more participation the better. Given that the organization is still in its growing phase, they run additional consultations with a random sample across Oregon. This way they can ensure more accurate results. Also, so results are not distorted, each participant is even a unique ID and URL for every consultation. This way each citizen can only participate one time per consultation.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oregon citizens are not the only participants in Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table. The governor and state departments also play an active role with this organization. The governor takes the results from the consultation, responds to the results, and uses the input in his decision making. Also, as is the case in the second consultation, departments or the state ask Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table to run a consultation. Curry County specifically asked Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table to run a consultation for their county.</p><p>As well, there are multiple ways an Oregon Citizen can be involved. They can take a seat at the table (participating in the consultations), spread the word to get more people involved, and make the legislators aware that this project is important. Also, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen table has created multiple media outlets for more participation. This would include a facebook page, twitter page, a website, and an e-mail.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having an online consultation can cause difficulties such as; people who want to participate not having internet access, people with disabilities, and language barriers. Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table has thought about these issues and is working through them. One thing they have done is partnered with libraries for people without internet access. Also they have set up assistance hours at local libraries and colleges for the second consultation. At these assistance hours member will do all they can to make it simple and possible for all citizens to participate. \u00a0They help with the signup process, creating an e-mail, answer questions, and more.<br />\u00a0</p><h3><u>Major projects and events</u></h3><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the help of partners including, American Leadership Forum, National Policy Consensus Center, Policy Consensus Initiative, Program for Public Consultation, Rural Development Initiatives, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table is able to host and promote their events through word-of-mouth exposure and financial assistance. These partners also help assist the users of Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table, who provide access to informational and financial resources to try and provide high quality discussion. Also,\u00a0Oregon's Kitchen Table is partnering with libraries, to help serve those in lower income areas, and do not have access to internet and other resources to participate in the disscussion of politcal issues.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Currently, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table hosts ongoing rounds of participation and discussion for various political issues. Once the round ends, they gather the information and publish it for viewers to see how their local area feels about various issues. Based on their website, it seems that anyone can sign-up and join in whenever they would like. Although this program is fairly new, it also seems as if Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table is beginning to spread the use of its organization by targeting a few various counties as well. Currently, it is Curry County\u2019s turn to deliberate on their issues, and they have about a month to do so. For the Curry County deliberation, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table is partnering with several locations such as libraries and schools to assist those who need help accessing resources to help them make informed decisions and opinions.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Additionally, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table uses resources through social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter to further and promote their project. With the help of these sites, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table keep those interested in participating aware of upcoming events, and dates for the next deliberation period.<br />\u00a0</p><h3><u>Funding</u></h3><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oregon's Kitchen Table relies on funding through a list of groups, including non-profit organizations, civic leaders, local and national state government leaders, and individual donations. The organization focuses on being formed off of a non-partisan basis through College of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University, and in turn, the University is a primary funder of the Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table. Another large name funder is The State of Oregon\u2019s Department of Administrative Services (DAS). The DAS\u2019s mission is primarily to serve the people of Oregon through government, which works to make legislative decisions and inform the people.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The organization also relies on funding by other independent, charitable foundations, including the Johnson Family Foundation, Circle Foundation, Ford Family Foundation, Oregon Community Foundation, &amp; Meyer Memorial Trust. The donations and assistance from these local foundations help the Oregon Kitchen Table to continue to spread their organization and provide a solid monetary foundation. Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table makes sure there is a diversity of funders to make sure the results are not geared toward one specific group.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As far as funding by citizens go, the website for Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table lists a section for their general public to take action, and provides a link for anyone to provide a monetary donation as well, making it easy and accessibly for further contributions.</p><h3><u>Publications</u></h3><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Oregon's Kitchen Table organization emphasizes itself on being an outlet for voices to be heard, and input to be used and shown as a result. They have done this by publishing their findings for public viewers, as well as for the government and legislators to see. Titled \u201cOregon\u2019s Kitchen Table \u2013 First Consultation Education Outcome Area and Justice System Findings\u201d, the program seeks to encourage deliberation, as well as wanting to show the direct impact its citizens and participants are making in Oregon politics.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0These publishings are provided for groups and individuals to see the results of those who deliberated with Oregon Kitchen Table. In this first set of published results, which consisted primarily of tallied results from a survey about the local government\u2019s budgeting, Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table was able to divide these issues into a few sub-categories, which included, education, healthy people, the economy and jobs, and healthy environment issues.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The findings consisted of results from 2,790 Oregon residents who participated in the discussion, as well as an additional 423 who took a survey. Overall, the creators took these results, and made a seven page document with information and analysis for those to see. This document had several different pieces of content to help readers decide their opinions on various issues in Oregon, as well as help government legislators view what issues are most important to its constituents. The information in this publication came in a few different forms, and was organized in order for viewers. This included, summaries of the issues at hand, tables that show data from survey questions, quotes from participants, and various sources cited.

Featured in Policyconsensus.org, they state that the goal of this program is to \u201cprovide leaders with high-quality feedback on issues that matter to Oregonians\u201d. Despite much coverage on this program, not every publication on Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table has been positive. According to a large Oregon political blog, the writer vocalizes their opinions on how \u00a0Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table doesn\u2019t address the much tougher issues, and shows disappointment with how many important policies were left off of the survey given to citizens.</p><h3><u>Advisory Board:\u00a0</u></h3><p>\u00a0</p><p>As listed on Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table website, the advisory board members are as follows:</p><ul><li>Steve Bass</li><li>Greg Chaimov</li><li>Adam Davis</li><li>Verne Duncan</li><li>Carol Ford</li><li>David Frohnmayer</li><li>Susan Hammer</li><li>Michael Jordan</li><li>Phil Keisling</li><li>Steven Kull</li><li>Tom Kelly</li><li>Lynn Lundquist</li><li>Greg Macpherson</li><li>Ron Saxton</li><li>Beverly Stein</li><li>Faye Stewart</li><li>Carl Talton</li><li>Linda Tamura</li><li>Robin Teater</li><li>Bill Thorndike</li><li>Larry Wallack</li><li>Bill Wyatt</li></ul><h2><u>Project Partners:\u00a0</u></h2><p>\u00a0</p><p>As listed on Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table website, the project partners are as follows:</p><ul><li>American Leadership Forum</li><li>Davis, Hibbitts &amp; Midghall Inc.</li><li>Healthy Democracy</li><li>The \u00a0Luke Center for Catalytic Leadership</li><li>National Policy Consensus Center</li><li>Policy Consensus Initiative</li><li>Program for Public Consultation</li><li>Rural Development Initiatives</li></ul><h2><u>Funders:</u></h2><p>\u00a0</p><p>As listed on Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table, the funders are as follows:</p><ul><li>Circle Foundation</li><li>Ford Family Foundation</li><li>Johnson Family Foundation</li><li>Oregon Community Foundation</li><li>Meyer Memorial Trust</li><li>Portland State University College of Urban and Public Affairs</li><li>PSG Foundation</li><li>The State of Oregon (Department of Administrative Services)</li></ul><h3><u>Secondary Sources:\u00a0</u></h3><p>\u00a0</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://daveporter.typepad.com/global_strategies/2012/06/oregons-kitchen-table-misses-the-tougher-choices.html\">http://daveporter.typepad.com/global_strategies/2012/06/oregons-kitchen-table-misses-the-tougher-choices.html</a></li><li><a href=\"http://elgl.org/2012/05/04/take-a-seat-at-oregons-kitchen-table/\">http://elgl.org/2012/05/04/take-a-seat-at-oregons-kitchen-table/</a></li><li><a href=\"http://healthydemocracyfund.org/take-a-seat-at-oregons-kitchen-table/\">http://healthydemocracyfund.org/take-a-seat-at-oregons-kitchen-table/</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/Pages/about_us.aspx\">http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/Pages/about_us.aspx</a></li><li><a href=\"http://oregonskitchentable.org/\">http://oregonskitchentable.org/</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/06/portland_state_university_laun.html\">http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/06/portland_state_university_laun.htl</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.policyconsensus.org/publications/news/PCI_Newsletter_May_12.html\">http://www.policyconsensus.org/publications/news/PCI_Newsletter_May_12.html</a></li><li>Sarah Giles telephone interview November 8th, 2012 (Oregon\u2019s Kitchen Table project manager)</li><li>vimeo.com/43655075</li></ul><h3><u>Mailing Address:\u00a0</u></h3><p>\u00a0</p><p>NPCC</p><p>P.O Box 751</p><p>Portland, OR 97201\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "Portland", "tags": null, "geo_province": "Oregon", "title_en": "Oregon's Kitchen Table", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/oregons-kitchen-table-0", "geo_phone": "503.725.9080", "geo_latitude": "45\u00b0 30' 20.1708\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "1759", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "122\u00b0 41' 17.574\" W", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "For Profit", "updated_date": "2014-07-17T09:26:02", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "Robert-Bosch-Stra\u00dfe 7", "executive_director": "Dr. Tobias Klug, Dr. Robert Lokaiczyk", "post_date": "2013-02-05T16:15:53", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "Deutsch - German", "geo_postal_code": "64293", "id": "776", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Germany", "content_country": "Germany", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Budgeting||Science &amp; Technology||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<h3>Schwerpunkte und Aktivit\u00e4ten</h3><p>Die wer denkt was GmbH ist eine Ausgr\u00fcndung der Technischen Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, die sich auf digitale B\u00fcrgerbeteiligung und Anliegenmanagement spezialisiert hat.

Das Verfahren wurde mehrfach evaluiert und in Zusammenarbeit mit B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrgern optimiert. Die wer denkt was GmbH konzipiert das Verfahren mit der Stadt und \u00fcbernimmt die technische Durchf\u00fchrung.</p><p>Wie in den Jahren zuvor startete der Darmst\u00e4dter B\u00fcrgerhaushalt 2014 mit einer von der wer denkt was GmbH und der Stadt Darmstadt organisierten Auftaktveranstaltung, bei der die teilnehmenden B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger u. a. \u00fcber die Haushaltslage sowie den Ablauf des Verfahrens informiert wurden und Fragen stellen konnten. Die Informationsphase begann jedoch schon zuvor: Auf der Internetseite des B\u00fcrgerhaushalts <a href=\"http://www.da-bei.darmstadt.de/\" target=\"_blank\">www.da-bei.darmstadt.de</a> wurden Informationen zu den einzelnen Produktbereichen und zum Verfahren sowie der Haushaltsentwurf bereitgestellt. Per Flyer, durch die Presse und mittels Werbung in Bussen und Bahnen wurde gezielt auf den B\u00fcrgerhaushalt aufmerksam gemacht. Einen sehr komfortablen und schnellen Einstieg in das Thema bot wie jedes Jahr zudem der von der wer denkt was GmbH umgesetzte offene Haushalt.\u00a0</p><p>Am Tag der Auftaktveranstaltung startete auch die Konsultationsphase, in der B\u00fcrgerinnen und B\u00fcrger sowohl \u00fcber die Internetplattform als auch per Post, Fax und Telefon Ihre Vorschl\u00e4ge einbringen konnten. Die Diskussion wurde von den Mitarbeitern der wer denkt was GmbH moderiert. Auch beantworteten sie Fragen zur Plattform. Inhaltlichen Fragen hingegen widmete sich das eigens eingerichtete Redaktionsteam der Stadt Darmstadt. In der anschlie\u00dfenden Abstimmungsphase wurden die in den acht Themenbereichen eingebrachten Ideen mittels der Abstimmungsfunktion priorisiert: So wurden die Top3 jedes Themenbereichs der Verwaltung zur Pr\u00fcfung vorgelegt. Ein \u00e4hnliches Vorgehen hatte sich bereits 2013 bew\u00e4hrt: Insgesamt 21 Vorschl\u00e4ge (aus damals noch sieben verschiedenen Themenbereichen) wurden an die Politik weitergegeben. Im Gegensatz zum Vorjahr wurden dar\u00fcber hinaus alle eingereichten Vorschl\u00e4ge zur Kenntnisnahme vorgelegt. Alle Ergebnisse und Stellungnahmen wurden dokumentiert und k\u00f6nnen ebenso wie die Rechenschaftsberichte online eingesehen werden.</p><p>Seit Beginn des B\u00fcrgerhaushalts im Jahr 2012 haben sich \u00fcber 700 Nutzer auf der Plattform registriert, Ideen eingebracht und abgestimmt. Dabei hat sich die Kombination aus Information und Konsultation sowie die parallele M\u00f6glichkeit zur Online- und Offlinebeteiligung etabliert. Prozesse und Abl\u00e4ufe werden kontinuierlich durch die Stadt Darmstadt und die wer denkt was GmbH gemeinsam evaluiert und weiterentwickelt \u2013 so z. B. in einem im Nachgang des B\u00fcrgerhaushalts 2013 durchgef\u00fchrten Workshop, bei dem sich interessierte Darmst\u00e4dterinnen und Darmst\u00e4dter bei der Weiterentwicklung des Verfahrens einbringen konnten.</p><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://werdenktwas.de\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.werdenktwas.de</a></p>", "geo_city": "Darmstadt", "tags": "B\u00fcrgerhaushalt||Stadtplanung",

Today this sovereignty, appropriated by States, linked indissolubly to capitalism -be it State or private-, is used to maximize the flow of production-consumption-taxpaying (with the corresponding consequences in the ecosystems), this payment allowing States or associations of States to increase their power and influence and to compete in the international arena against other State bodies. In order to maximize this flow, State intervention, supporting business corporations, is permanent in the legal, economic and diplomatic fields, both at international and internal level, which lately has become quite obvious because of the amount of public money destined to save the corporations and the financial system from failure through nationalizations, aids, tax breaks and other State activities.</p><p>Today the couple State-capitalism programs the whole life of the individual through the promise of welfarism and finishes by eliminating any autonomy and freedom of conscience of persons and communities in which they are inserted.</p><p>For this reason, we in the Partido da Terra consider it essential to recover our real sovereignty: our sovereignty to decide as citizens, reclaiming our right of direct deliberation and sovereignty as a means of expressing the political and legal will; our sovereignty to organize politically and administratively our territory and communities, making possible the link between people and land; our sovereignty to exercise responsibility towards the environment in which we are inserted, conserving it and improving it for future generations; our sovereignty to produce the healthy food we need and the clean energy which guarantees our quality of life; our sovereignty to work and exchange fairly the fruits of our effort and determination; our sovereignty to care for our own, for our communities and for ourselves; our sovereignty to be ourselves, cultivating the creative spirit that characterizes us as a people; our sovereignty to express ourselves in the language which is our own, taking our word to all continents.</p><p>But sovereignty is nothing without sustainability, without striving for the necessary balance with individual people, with other peoples and with the environment, guaranteeing a framework of community and ecological relations which ensure continuity in time through responsible management and the preservation of our resources. That is why we call for the direct participation of people in political life, taking account of their active responsibility. That is why we defend sustainable ways of life, generalizing the application of proposals of ecological design and appropriate technologies for habitation, transport, productive processes and waste management. That is why we adopt the proposals of food sovereignty, local production and sustainable agriculture launched by the agrarian movement. That is why we call for a new community economy, based on ethical consumption and the autonomy of the worker which allows us to design our own alternatives to the global crisis. That is why we proclaim the ethics of community care which reinforces the links between individuals, families, communities, managing and foreseeing their needs of support and social care. That is why we opt for the logical traditional cultures, for the preservation and cultivation of our heritage and for the linguistic integration in the domain which is natural to us.</p><p>The programme proposals which follow are not free from the contradictions inherent in a political project which, defending direct democracy, aims at participating in a system where power is assumed by professional \u201crepresentatives\u201d. In this scenario, where power is distributed in such unequal way, experience demonstrated that democracy, in its strictest sense, becomes superficial. That is why our proposals are directed to decentralizing power, returning it to people. We appeal for the restructuring of the concept of politics as an active citizens\u2019 practice, emphasizing local power, where direct democracy has its foundation.</p><p>However, we don\u2019t give up participating at all levels of the present representative \u201cpolitics\u201d, trying to inject in the institutions almost an anti-political way (in relation to what today is understood by \u201cdoing politics\u201d) of managing governance, public service and decision-making. We want to propose a real paradigm change which restores the essence of democracy, in its only literal and legitimate sense: that of direct democracy.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is not our intention to eliminate the existing parliamentary institutions (parliaments and council chambers), but to turn them into tools for confederative management where the delegates from sovereign assemblies may make decisions in the framework of the imperative and revocable mandate, that is where the citizens can assume full responsibility for the management of their problems, developing solutions in a collective way.</p><p>We consider that, as the Partido da Terra, we can influence today\u2019s institutions, favouring the establishment of a transition into tomorrow\u2019s institutions, but we don\u2019t intend to control the former or the latter, even because from our point of view the parties, as they are understood today, are not only unnecessary but they are also counterproductive. The principal way of influencing which we aim at exercising from the Partido da Terra is not the control but the diffusion of ideas and practices through example. Our objective not being to take power (nor the benefits and privileges that it accords today to those who detain it) but the mobilization and liberation of energies and creative potential of our communities, of our members, of our society, the proposals here presented are designed for all. The home of the Partido da Terra is made up of our communities.</p><p>This programme is not, and does not try to be, comprehensive. Although we care about everything, we don\u2019t claim the primacy of our opinion on any question or particular group of interests. No aspect of life is beyond our preoccupations, but we do not pretend to define everything as political nor to achieve a consensus on everything, be it in the party or in society. We don\u2019t conceive of any linear progression for homogeneity or heterogeneity, but we try to assume and defend the elements of commonalty and diversity which best contribute to the realization of our proposals.</p><p>The close reading of this programme will evidence the presence of three internal tendencies which are complementary in the Land Party: one conservative tendency which tries to create the future conditions perpetuating and invigorating the traditional values and practices of our society, which favour the transforming principles here advocated; an innovative tendency which stimulates the adoption of new practices and values; and an integrating tendency designing future alternatives which reconcile the differences between the other two. All the persons making up the Land Party try to contribute to all three tendencies, deciding on and trying consensus solutions according to the concrete problems.</p><p>The programme here presented is necessarily a text which is incomplete and a collective (re)creation, which tries to be enriched by the critique, contributions and proposals of civil society, bodies and individuals, beyond the Partido da Terra. We hope that its public presentation is a dynamic and bidirectional process, gathering and adding up multiple perspectives. And, as a non-comprehensive text, the programme will be complemented with specific political documents in which we aim at widening and detailing many of the proposals that are here enumerated briefly, as well as others equally important which lie beyond the dimensions of this programme. We trust in the cooperation of everybody.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>The Party's by-laws explicitly prohibit receiving any kind of governmental subsidy and members elected to office are also prohibited from earning any salary, as the Party defends that politics should be deprofessionalized and based on direct democracy assembly decision-making. Party-members pay no dues and are expected to work localy (at parish and county levels) to disseminate the platform. The Party has no bank account or tax registration and election campaigns are organized at a zero or close-to-zero budget. In the first major elections contested by the Party (October 2012) the total budget was 120 euros, including the distribution of thousands of seeds.\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>Edi\u00e7\u00f5es da Terra (Publishing House):\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.partidodaterra.net/edicoes-da-terra/\">http://www.partidodaterra.net/edicoes-da-terra/</a></p><p>O Peteiro (magazine):\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.partidodaterra.net/peteiro/\">http://www.partidodaterra.net/peteiro/</a></p><p>(Free PDF download in both cases)</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.partidodaterra.net\">http://www.partidodaterra.net</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"http://facebook.com/ptgaliza\">http://facebook.com/ptgaliza</a></p><p>Youtube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ptgalizatv\">http://www.youtube.com/user/ptgalizatv</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Partido da Terra (Party of the Earth / Party of the Land)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/partido-da-terra-party-earth-party-land", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "2021", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": "0", "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"423752_368229526533273_1097514861_n.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2013-06-18T03:00:56", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2013-06-18T03:00:56", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "1086", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Egyptian Ministry of Economic Development (MoED)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/egyptian-ministry-economic-development-moed", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "2161", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2013-03-12T17:10:34", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2013-03-12T17:10:34", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "798", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/regional-district-okanagan-similkameen", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "2254", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2013-03-15T16:41:08", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2013-03-15T12:35:15", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "800", "description": null, "video": "802", "geo_name": "Europe", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Arts &amp; Culture||Environment||Human Rights||Gender &amp; Racial Equality||Identity &amp; Diversity||Immigration||Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)||Other", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>European Alternatives is a transnational membership organisation promoting democracy,\u00a0equality and culture beyond the nation state.\u00a0The nation state is no longer the appropriate political form in which to define democratic\u00a0decision-making and active citizenship, equality between people, the respect and\u00a0extension of rights.

The Festival became transnational and took the name the Transeuropa Festival in 2009 (<a href=\"http://www.transeuropafestival.eu\">www.transeuropafestival.eu</a>).

Running a decision-making process is a profession. , but it cannot be detached from expertise in the field itslef.\u00a0We perceive every participant as a costumer. Those who are willing to contribute their time for consultations must be heard and get an update on their impact.\u00a0\u00a0We work hard to make policy accessible and comprehensible.

It is about crowd sourcing legislation, deliberative and participatory democracy and citizens initiatives. It is a non-profit organization based in Helsinki, Finland. It helps citizens and NGO's with national citizens' initiatives, EU citizens initiatives and develops the online services for collaborating, sharing and signing the initiatives.<br /><br />In March 2012 the Finnish Parliament passed the Citizens\u2019 Initiative Act. The Act allows any citizen to present a law to Parliament, providing they can get the support of 50,000 citizens. If a proposal gains more than 50.000 signatures within six months,<br />then the Parliament is obliged to discuss and vote on the initiative.<br /><br />However, there was no ministry to accompany the Citizens Initiative i.e. no one to help citizens to weigh options or draft the text for proposals. The Open Ministry tries to fill this gap and to help people make laws.<br /><br />The site allows Finns to submit proposals for legislation, which are then debated and refined by the site\u2019s membership.<br /><br />The Open Ministry doesn\u2019t have opinions as an institution. The Open Ministry doesn\u2019t present any ideas or have any opinions itself.<br /><br />Issues dealt with have included: copyright, gender-neutral marriage, bullying in schools, open data, one official language.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://openministry.info/\">http://openministry.info/</a><br /><a href=\"http://avoinministerio.fi\">http://avoinministerio.fi</a></p>", "geo_city": "Helsinki", "tags": "Crowdsourcing||lawmaking||Open Policy Making||Finland", "geo_province": "", "title_en": " The Open Ministry (Avoin ministeri\u00f6)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/open-ministry-avoin-ministeri", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "60\u00b0 10' 23.9664\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "2794", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "24\u00b0 56' 27.69\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"avatar_9943fc390f2f_128.png\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2013-06-11T02:37:39", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2013-06-11T02:37:39", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "1078", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "University of the Andes", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/university-andes", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "2161", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2013-06-11T01:53:08", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2013-06-11T01:53:08", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "1074", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": "United States", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "City of Dresden", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/city-dresden", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "2161", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2013-12-06T16:23:41", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "18 Victoria Park Square<br />Bethnal Green", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2013-12-06T15:44:44", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "E2 9PF", "id": "1609", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "United Kingdom", "content_country": "United Kingdom", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>The Young Foundation is a leading independent centre for disruptive social innovation. We create new movements, institutions and companies that tackle the structural causes of inequality.</p><p>We work to create a more equal and just society, where each individual can be fulfilled in their own terms. We believe that little about the future of society is inevitable. Bound by our shared humanity, we believe we collectively have the power to shape the societies and communities we want to live in.</p><h3>History</h3><p>We were forged from a merger between the Institute of Community Studies and the Mutual Aid Centre, both creations of our namesake, the late Michael Young, leading social entrepreneur.</p><p>The Institute for Community Studies had been set up in 1954 as an urban studies think tank, with an emphasis on bringing academic research and practical social innovation together. It helped to create over 60 organisations, including the Open University and the Consumers\u2019 Association. Other innovations included Language line, International Alert, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the School for Social Entrepreneurs.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>We strive to be audacious and determined in our actions, and open and unrelenting in our thinking. We are politically alert but non-partisan. We use the tools of social research, disruptive social innovation, venturing, strategic design and movement building. Above all, we listen to people, putting what they think, feel and believe, their aspirations, their experiences and their lives at the heart of everything we do. In the last five years we\u2019ve launched 60 programmes and 138 publications across the country.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p><strong>TEPSIE:</strong> The TEPSIE research programme is aimed at developing tools, methods and policies to help inform the EU strategy for social innovation. Its purpose is to strengthen the foundations for other researchers, policy-makers and practitioners so that they can analyse and plan with greater confidence. The work involves mapping the field of social innovation, reviewing theories, models, methods and identifying gaps in existing practices and policies, as well as pointing towards the priorities for future strategies.</p><p><strong>Realising Ambition: </strong>The Young Foundation is a member of the consortium appointed to manage Realising Ambition which is a \u00a325 million <a href=\"http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Lottery Fund</a> supported programme investing in projects which have been proven to help children and young people to fulfil their potential, and avoid pathways into crime. Over the next five years, the programme will replicate the best evidence-based practice, reaching over 140,000 8- to 14- year olds across the UK.</p><p><strong>Better by Design: </strong>Working with BIG and partners, The Young Foundation is working with 15 high potential organisations that can see the potential through design thinking to put users at the centre of their services, improve outcomes and make their organisations more innovative.</p><p>The Young Foundation and Taylor Haig are working intensively with these organisations, guiding them through a design-led change process, drawing on user insight and using innovative but practical design techniques. BIG will be making small grants available to support the organisations at key points in the design and change process.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>The Young Foundation is a Registered Charity and Company Limited by Guarantee</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>In the last five years, The Young Foundation has launched 60 programmes and 138 publications across the country.

href=\"http://www.vitalizing-democracy.org\">Vitalizing Democracy</a><em> in 2010 and was a contestant for the 2011 Reinhard Mohn Prize. It was originally submitted by </em>Jeffrey Abelson<em>.</em></p><p>\"Song Of A Citizen\" is a non-profit, non-partisan collaboration of prominent thinkers and artists seeking to shine a bright spotlight on what we feel is the true root cause of our increasingly dysfunctional democracy -- the alarmingly low levels of civic and political literacy and sustained engagement by the average citizen in America. Our debut effort is an innovative series of Video Op-Eds for the internet featuring an array of nationally renowned political philosophers, authors, poets, journalists, historians, civic engagement experts, and deliberative democracy leaders -- each offering a different take on what it really means to be an engaged and effective citizen in modern times -- how we-the-people are measuring up -- how we can do better -- and why we must.</p><h2>Project Description</h2><h3>Structure and Process</h3><p>An ever expanding array of thinkers and artists brainstorm ways of communicating this critical message that politicians and pundits rarely discuss in public. Project initiator Abelson then refines the ideas, develops a creative approach, and works with participants to fashion their individual videos. Once complete, Song Of A Citizen engages with various civic engagement and other organizations to leverage all tools of social media to spread the word and generate awareness of the videos.</p><h3>Impact</h3><p>The solution can be found only in hearts and minds of ordinary citizens. It will take a decade or more to measure progress in that mysterious domain. Song Of A Citizen has no interest in directly impacting policy or political decisions. It exists solely to motivate citizens to acknowledge that that is their job, and provide tools and encouragement to help them get on with it.</p><h3>Detailed Information</h3><h4>Broader Context</h4><p>Not \"was\" but \"is\" and will be -- part of a series of Deliberative Democracy projects sponsored by major deliberation organizations -- which are organized for the express purpose of empowering citizens to generate a consensus about various policies, and turn their talk into action at the policy level.</p><h4>Type of Contribution by Participants</h4><p>They directly made decisions about project measures</p><h4>Target Group</h4><p>Phase-1: Wide array of cultural and media influence-shapers.</p><p>Phase-2: General Public.</p><h4>Total Number of People Addressed by the Project (approx.)</h4><p>300 million</p><h4>Total Number of Active Participants (approx.)</h4><p>75</p><h4>Specific Effort Made to Include Disadvantaged Groups</h4><p>Open for all - but no specific effort to address disadvantaged groups</p><p>When it comes to being a high performing citizen, we consider most of us to be disadvantaged, and therefore we strive to reach and engage everyone.</p><h4>Specific Effort Made to Strengthen Democratic Capacities</h4><p>Yes, Yes, Yes.

About 50 M\u20ac are dedicated each year to funding projects in the field of: citizens engagement in research and innovation, formal and informal education to science, gender equality and gender in research and innovation, open access to scientific results, ethics, and governance. The Commission has been funding participatory processes since 2002 and funds research to better understand and improve their methods and dynamics.</p><h1>Why \"Science in Society\" at European level?</h1><p>\"Science is part of almost every aspect of our lives. Although we rarely think about it, science makes extraordinary things possible. At the flick of a switch, we have light and electricity. When we are ill, science helps us get better. It tells us about the past, helps us with the present, and creates ways to improve our future. Scientific endeavour is as much about us as it is for us. Its place in society, therefore, is not to unfold quietly at the sidelines but to become a fundamental part of the game. Now more than ever, science must engage with us, and we must engage with science.</p><p>There are times when science can seem to lose its connection to society and its needs, and sometimes its objectives are not fully understood, even if they are well intended. The lack of a common language and rapid progress in many areas of research has increased the public's concern or contributed to ambivalence about the role that science and technology play in everyday life. But science cannot work in isolation, and advances in science and technology are not an objective in their own right.</p><h3>Build gateways with the public</h3><p>Of course, while new developments can improve our quality of life and understanding of the world, scientists and policymakers may not always properly assess the potential risks or take full account of the public's concerns. Opportunities must be created for scientists and the general public to exchange views in a two-way dialogue of mutual respect and trust.\"</p><p>Read more at <a

Activities of the INM are rooted in the core concepts of social justice and inclusion, respect for democratic values and the principles of sustainable development, in a spirit of open-mindedness and innovation. In its activities, the INM adopts a structured, deliberative three-pronged approach to contemporary issues: making needed information available, fostering informed debate and bringing forward proposals for positions or action.\u00a0<br /><br />The Institute was established in 2003 by a group of academics and figures from civil society brought together by Michel Venne, then (1990 to 2006) a journalist at the Montr\u00e9al French-language newspaper, Le Devoir. The founders of the Institute believed that there was a crucial need for an institution that could effectively inform public debate and promote citizen participation on issues relating to the place, the role and the needs of a small nation like Qu\u00e9bec in a globalized world.<br />The \u201cNew World\u201d is first and foremost the Americas, the physical territory of which Qu\u00e9bec is part. The expression also evokes the idea of renewal for our world, as exemplified by the spirit of explorers and discoverers. Another of the goals of the INM is precisely that: to explore and open up new horizons and celebrate successes, but also to look long and hard at the shortcomings, failures and needs of Qu\u00e9bec society, relative to the rest of the world. The INM\u2019s work is based on the firm conviction that the renewal of ideas entails citizen participation, because the introduction of new ideas cannot be the sole prerogative of experts or interest groups.<br /><br /><strong>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What does the INM do?</strong><br /><br />Activities of the INM centre around three key themes.<br /><br /><em>Key Theme 1: Development of Citizenship Skills</em><br /><br />The INM works to foster \u201ccitizenship attitudes\u201d and contribute to the development of citizenship skills for individuals and organizations. It develops transferable expertise, conducts ongoing monitoring of citizen participation and organizes activities designed to educate, train and mobilize individual Quebeckers or support their involvement in community action, in particular through its annual Summer and Winter Schools for young people between the ages of 15 and 35. The Institute runs information campaigns and takes public stands on questions of participation and democracy. In addition, through its consultancy service (INM services-conseil), it also provides services to help organizations, businesses and institutions establish quality \u201cparticipatory spaces\u201d. The Institute\u2019s organizational services are based on the best collaborative practice models known.<br /><br /><em>Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing debate on key issues for Qu\u00e9bec society</em><br /><br />The INM advocates ongoing debate on key issues for Qu\u00e9bec society. One illustration of this position is its creation of an open and easily accessible Agora or citizen think-tank. Quebeckers learn about participation by personally engaging in discussions on important public issues, knowing that the results of those discussions can potentially influence public policy or private initiatives. And the more they participate, the more they want to pursue their participation.<br /><br />The Agora has five basic components:<br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ongoing observation of the evolution of Qu\u00e9bec society and identification of issues that call for debate (in particular, through an advisory panel of publicly respected figures and publication annually of the almanac: L\u2019\u00e9tat du Qu\u00e9bec (meaning: The State of Qu\u00e9bec \u2013 not available in translation), an annual overview of Qu\u00e9bec society;<br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Information-gathering and, where relevant, production and dissemination of the information people need to participate in informed debate on current issues (preparation of theme-based kits on subjects such as health, the economy, culture, demography, mining development);\u00a0\u00a0<br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Organization of deliberative democracy activities ranging from simple round-table discussions to structured exchanges over a period of several months, known as Strategic Rendez-Vous;<br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dynamic facilitation of a web-based forum for discussion;<br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Active promotion of the ideas, projects and proposals arising from the discussions and debates it initiates, by communicating them to the general public and to policy-makers and by encouraging further reflection on outcomes (using instruments such as reports, reviews, publications, declarations\u2026).\u00a0\u00a0<br /><br /><em>Key Theme 3: Promotion of citizen participation, an essential component in the exercise and development of democratic rights</em><br /><br />The INM conducts a range of structured reflection and promotion activities on issues relating to democracy and citizen participation. It collects and makes available information on the current state of knowledge on democracy and citizen participation. It brings together diverse stakeholders for discussions on public participation, consultation mechanisms and the relationship between participatory and representative democracy. It engages in public debate on the way institutions are evolving and on the exercise of democratic rights, prepares advisory briefs and may, on occasion, take positions on questions of public policy, private sector initiatives, or current issues or events involving citizen participation, the way democratic institutions function, or the organization of participatory processes. The Institute also promotes citizen participation through its involvement in national or international issue tables or coalitions of relevance to its mission, and through its public presence and as part of a communications strategy that uses both traditional news media and social media to reach different target networks.<br />\u2003<br /><strong>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INM Programs</strong><br /><br /><em>Key Theme 1:</em><br /><br /><em>Skills development for individual citizens and for organizations</em><br />Working with individual citizens<br /><br /><strong>Citizenship Schools: Summer and Winter Schools</strong><br />Since 2004, the INM has offered Summer Schools on Citizenship to young people between the ages of 15 and 35. Over a five-day period, they can hear presentations and participate in round table discussions, seminars and workshops, all designed to enhance their knowledge or understanding of the major issues of our times and help augment their citizenship skills.<br /><br />In a convivial and relaxed atmosphere, some five to seven hundred participants discuss current issues and define the kind of world they want to live in.<br /><br />In winter, Qu\u00e9bec college students between the ages of 17 and 20 can attend the Winter School that the INM has now organized since 2007.<br /><br />Further information is available (in French only) at <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/programmes/ecole-dete\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/programmes/ecole-dete</a><br /><br /><strong>\u00c0 go, on change le monde!\u00a0 \u2013 Social Entrepreneurship</strong><br /><br />Since 2007, in association with the Caisse d\u2019\u00e9conomie solidaire Desjardins, the INM has supported and promoted social entrepreneurship projects undertaken by young Quebeckers. Social entrepreneurs are people who propose practical and innovative solutions in response to social issues and who apply entrepreneurial principles in the creation and management of projects with pronounced social impacts, while ensuring community involvement in the process.<br /><br />The program, \u00c0 go, on change le monde! offers young social entrepreneurs a range of different forms of support: access to information or advice, financial assistance, references to professional services, a mentoring network and a young social entrepreneurs\u2019 club.<br />A further goal of the program is the development of increased public awareness of the role played by young social entrepreneurs in Qu\u00e9bec.<br /><br />Further information is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.agoonchangelemonde.qc.ca/\">http://www.agoonchangelemonde.qc.ca/</a><br />\u2003<br /><strong>Working with organizations: INM services-conseil</strong><br /><br />The Institut du Nouveau Monde provides four kinds of services to organizations: process support, facilitation of consultations or events, training workshops and lectures or presentations.<br /><br /><strong>Process support</strong><br />INM\u2019s consultancy service can provide needed support to organizations looking for significant results around a variety of processes:\u00a0 carrying out consultations involving citizen participation, establishing innovative internal working groups, organizing an event designed to provoke reflection and identify priorities, or wanting guidance around a forecasting and strategic planning process. INM services-conseil can play a facilitation role for a process already under way or help plan the different steps needed for a given project.\u00a0<br /><br /><strong>Group facilitation</strong><br />Effective facilitation happens when the serious goal of having a group jointly come to meaningful conclusions is achieved through the use of a relaxed and fun-filled approach. INM services-conseil offers added-value service in that it can suggest the use of less familiar discussion methods which nonetheless produce tangible results: open forums, caf\u00e9 conversations, 4-6 huddles, buzz sessions, the scenario technique, etc. In addition, the service works with a range of innovative and creative approaches such as social intervention theatre, street animation and video screenings to highlight particular issues, while also using more traditional facilitation methods, where appropriate.\u00a0<br /><br /><strong>Training workshops</strong><br />Due to its expertise and use of participatory activities such as role-playing, experience-based approaches, round tables and situation simulation techniques, the INM has come to be recognized as a leader in its field. For questions on how best to communicate publicly, craft powerful messages or generate creative ideas, for looking more deeply into issues such as participatory local governance or any other issue relevant to the INM\u2019s mission, the consultancy team can propose innovative approaches that will help participants better understand and retain the information they have been given.<br /><br /><strong>\u00a0Lectures or presentations</strong><br />INM services-conseil has speakers available for lectures or presentations in a variety of different formats to explain the results of the Institute\u2019s reflections and practices on the question of citizen participation. Alternatively, it can also draw on outside resources if a client organization would prefer to hear a range of points of view on a topic, give participants the opportunity to form their own potentially opposing opinions, and so spark debate on a subject.<br /><br />Further information on INM services-conseil is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/services-conseil\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/services-conseil</a><br /><br />\u2003<br /><em>Examples of projects undertaken for outside organizations</em><br /><br /><strong>Citizens\u2019 jury</strong><br /><br />At the request of the Director General of Elections for Qu\u00e9bec (DGEQ), the Institut du Nouveau Monde organized in January 2010 a citizens\u2019 jury on the issue of the funding of political parties by private firms or other groups. Members of the jury first attended hearings where expert witnesses presented a range of background information on the topic, then deliberated together before submitting their advice to the DGEQ.<br />Further information is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/jury-citoyen.html\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/jury-citoyen.html</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>Tout le monde \u00e0 table</strong><br /><br />Staff and the travelling nutritionist from the Tout le monde \u00e0 Table convoy travelled around the 17 regions in Qu\u00e9bec to meet with a range of Qu\u00e9bec families in different parts of the province. They wanted to get input from parents of children between 0 and 12 on issues around food and eating, such as the pleasures of eating well, eating together as a family and meal preparation. The information collected from the parents has been used by public health workers, elected policy-makers, the food industry and consumer groups to support the development of effective strategies for healthy eating.<br /><br />Further information is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.toutlemondeatable.org/\">http://www.toutlemondeatable.org/</a></p><p><strong>Agenda 21 for Culture</strong><br />The development of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Agenda 21 for Culture was the responsibility of the province\u2019s then Minist\u00e8re de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition f\u00e9minine . Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Agenda 21 for Culture is a\u00a0 21-point framework for action designed to spur a renewed vision of cultural development. Through its organization of corresponding public events and management of the project website, the Institute played a leadership role in the development of a comprehensive dialogue around the topic, as well as providing input for the final version of the document.<br />Further information is available at: <a href=\"http://www.agenda21c.gouv.qc.ca/\">http://www.agenda21c.gouv.qc.ca/</a><br />\u2003<br /><strong>Province-wide citizen forums for the Bouchard-Taylor Commission</strong><br /><br />Two respected Qu\u00e9bec intellectuals and specialists in cultural diversity, Doctors G\u00e9rard Bouchard and Charles Taylor, were appointed in 2008 to head this historic Commission.<br /><br />The two co-presidents commissioned the Institut du Nouveau Monde to organize four province-wide citizen consultation forums. Based on its expertise in organizing structured opportunities for productive citizen debate, the INM recommended the use of interactive events on different themes around cultural differences and the concept of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d, as a way to encourage all Quebeckers to voice their opinions on the key issues involved.<br /><br /><em>Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing public debate</em><br /><br /><em>Our publications</em><br /><br /><strong>L\u2019\u00e9tat du Qu\u00e9bec</strong><br /><br />The INM puts out an annual French-language flagship publication, L\u2019\u00e9tat du Qu\u00e9bec, a compilation reference aimed at a general (non-specialist) readership and providing a comprehensive portrait of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s political, economic, cultural and social situation for the current year, together with the most recently available statistics.<br /><br />Further information (in French only) on this book, available in bookstores throughout Qu\u00e9bec, can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.letatduquebec.qc.ca\">http://www.letatduquebec.qc.ca</a><br /><br />A number of supplements to this same publication are prepared for use in INM program activities.\u00a0 The Institute also publishes a magazine on social entrepreneurship, \u00c0 go! (in French only).</p><p><em>Dynamic organization of broad-based consultation and debate</em><br /><br /><strong>Strategic Rendez-Vous Forums</strong><br /><br />The purpose of the INM\u2019s Strategic Rendez-Vous forums is to encourage open and informed debate between experts and members of the community, so as to map out a shared vision of the Qu\u00e9bec we want and the kind of world we want to be in, twenty years from now.<br />The Institute uses a three-pronged approach: making needed information available, fostering informed debate and bringing forward proposals for positions or actions.<br /><br />\u00a0A steering committee of experts in the field proposes the questions to be debated and identifies relevant and easily understandable documentation. In each of the regions of Qu\u00e9bec, community members are invited to take part in the debate on the issues identified. They meet again at the end of the process to finalize orientations and adopt proposals for concrete action. Outcomes from each of the Strategic Rendez-Vous forums take the form of recommendations communicated to the public and presented to both stakeholders and authorities in the community concerned. Strategic Rendez-Vous forums have so far been organized around topics ranging from the economy and health to culture and intergenerational issues.<br /><br />Further (French only) information on the two topics currently being debated (the first, social inequalities, and the second, democracy and citizen participation) can be found (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/inegalites/presentation\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/inegalites/presentation</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/democratie/presentation\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/democratie/presentation</a><br /><br /><strong>Public conversations on the future of mining in Qu\u00e9bec</strong><br /><br />The Institute\u2019s Public Conversations on the Future of Mining in Qu\u00e9bec were held to objectively and impartially identify for the general public the main issues arising from the exploration and extraction of mineral resources in Qu\u00e9bec, in addition to providing an open forum where citizens and community stakeholders could raise questions, express their concerns and, most importantly, explore potential solutions.<br /><br />In this way, the INM gives Qu\u00e9bec citizens, organizations concerned about these issues and public policy-makers the opportunity to obtain information within an objective framework and engage in open-minded debate with others on the issue.<br />Further information (French only) is available at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/avenir-minier\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/avenir-minier</a><br /><br />\u2003<br /><strong>The Future of Higher Education</strong></p><p>Qu\u00e9bec witnessed unusually high levels of mobilization and unrest in Spring 2011. The provincial government subsequently acknowledged the need to re-establish a climate for dialogue by organizing a Summit on Higher Education.<br /><br />In keeping with the spirit of the pre-Summit process, the INM invited Qu\u00e9bec citizens to join the collective reflection process. A total of four forums were held to allow Quebeckers of all ages and backgrounds to give their views about what higher education in Qu\u00e9bec should be in the 21st century. A summary of the discussions in these forums was presented in a report to the Minister of Higher Education, in advance of the Summit.<br /><br />To the same end, a special Summit-focused Winter School was held for Quebeckers between the ages of 15 and 35.<br /><br />Further information (French only) is available at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/enseignement-superieur/presentation\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/enseignement-superieur/presentation</a><br /><br /><strong>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Participatory and collaborative approaches used by the INM</strong><br /><br />The following are some examples of the approaches used to support our different activities.<br /><br /><strong>\u00a0Social Innovation Laboratory - LABIS</strong><br />\u00a0<br />LABIS is a process designed to encourage social innovation in response to complex social problems. It is organized in several stages and brings together stakeholders or citizens who embark on a collective reflection about issues to be addressed, using a deliberative approach that allows for complexity, creativity and diverging views of the future. The group first considers people\u2019s different personal perceptions and realities, then jointly develops a comprehensive vision on which to base target strategies and innovative projects.<br /><br />Further information is available at:<br /><a href=\"http://inm.qc.ca/nos-activites/labis-laboratoire-dinnovation-sociale.html\">http://inm.qc.ca/nos-activites/labis-laboratoire-dinnovation-sociale.html</a><br /><br /><strong>Open Forum</strong><br />This approach allows participants in an event to design their own personal participation plans. Free of time constraints, and coming and going as they please, they develop personalized schedules, propose topics, and become involved in discussions of interest to them. The activity evolves in parallel with the rhythm of the resulting discussion circles, whose members are constantly changing. The goal of the experience is for participants to imagine innovative solutions to problems faced by their organizations, and allow them to see these problems differently as a result of the Open Forum approach.</p><p><br /><strong>Scenario Technique</strong><br />The Scenario Technique is a local deliberative forum that brings together representatives of a range of different groups (political decision makers, private-sector representatives, technical experts, resident citizens, etc.), all of whom have some degree of expertise in their respective communities. This mixed group is divided into teams which identify positive and negative scenarios for given future situations. Participants reflect on the difficulties encountered, draw up their own scenarios, then together design a local plan of action.<br /><br /><strong>4-6 Huddles</strong><br />A 4-6 Huddle is a perception and information sharing technique aimed at clarifying an issue in a context conducive to in-depth deliberation and debate. The method was developed as an ice-breaking activity for group events and takes the form of rounds of four to six huddles formed by four to six participants who change with every round.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br /><br /><strong>Caf\u00e9 Conversations</strong><br />Our Caf\u00e9 Conversations provide opportunities for exchange, debate and dialogue among different people concerned or affected by particular issues. Working in groups of four to eight, people take part in rounds of discussion on one or several topics. The groups work simultaneously in the same room but participants change tables after each round, so as to spread ideas and extend discussion. The event ends with a plenary session, where the main ideas and conclusions developed in the discussions are presented to all participants.<br /><br /><strong>Citizen Caravans</strong><br />Citizen Caravans are a \u201cstreet happening\u201d technique used to stimulate reflection on current issues among people of all backgrounds and ages. Activities are playful, lively, and short-lasting. They are held in public spaces, such as streets, shopping centres or festivals, etc. where people can freely come and go. They are designed to appeal to children, teenagers and adults alike.<br /><br />The Caravans are results-based activities developed as an improved tool for taking the pulse of citizens on a range of topics. Street events are performed by actors equipped with portable suitcases stocked with a vast array of stimulating and amusing props developed by the INM.<br /><br /><strong>Buzz Sessions</strong><br />Each Buzz Session brings together small groups of people who, within a short period of time, must complete a task focusing on a particular problem. The tight deadline creates a sense of urgency that drives the group to propose ideas \u201cin the rough\u201d which, while not fully developed, nevertheless contribute to exploration of the subject under consideration.<br /><br /><strong>Panels or Citizens\u2019 Juries</strong><br />A citizens\u2019 jury is a group of twenty or so randomly selected people who can contribute to the political decision-making process. Participants are asked to examine and debate an important public policy issue. By the final stage of the process, the group is expected to be able to come to a collective decision on the subject.<br /><br />Citizens\u2019 juries are often established when decision-makers feel trapped in the gridlock created by strongly divided public opinion and conflicting interests. To start with, needed background information is presented to the jury, which first debates the issue, then formulates recommendations that can be drawn on by policy-makers in the decisions they will later take.<br /><br /><strong>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Outcomes of the INM\u2019s Work</strong><br /><br />The work carried out by the Institute has led to an increase in citizen participation in the democratic life of Qu\u00e9bec. The organization is strongly committed to the broad dissemination of information on issues of importance for Qu\u00e9bec, to advocating ongoing public debate on these issues and to promoting the ideas and projects resulting from that debate in the public arena and among decision-makers.<br /><br />By increasing citizen participation, the INM has helped transform the political culture of Qu\u00e9bec, as well as legitimizing and showing the value of this kind of participation. At the same time, it is developing and applying new approaches, building up a wealth of transferable knowledge and creating models for dialogue and participation that can be drawn on to change the behaviours of opinion-leaders in Qu\u00e9bec society and reform our democratic institutions. The INM has led Quebeckers to develop a taste for democratic activism.\u00a0<br /><br />Some results of the INM\u2019s work: in numbers and in public recognition<br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through its various activities, the INM now reaches more than 20,000 people every year. Some 15,000 receive the Institute\u2019s newsletter and 350 people are registered members of the organization.<br /><br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 2004, around 5,000 young people have participated in citizenship education activities in the context of the INM\u2019s Summer and Winter Schools. Over a five-day period, they interact around presentations, round table discussions, seminars and workshops. The entire process is designed to help them increase their knowledge and understanding of the major issues of our time, while also learning civic skills. The INM\u2019s Summer School was recognized in 2008 as a key component in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Youth Action Strategy, for a period of five years. Furthermore, in 2010, the Summer School received one of three prizes awarded by the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, for its outstanding civic education practices. Lastly, in 2011, the same Summer School was identified as one of the ten most innovative and promising projects among the 300 projects supported by the Montr\u00e9al Island Youth Forum.<br /><br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 2007, as part of the program \u00c0 go, on change le monde!, more than 900 young entrepreneurs have been able to receive information, advice, financial assistance and references to professional services, call on a network of mentors and join a young social entrepreneurs\u2019 club.<br /><br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 2004, over 12,000 people have participated in citizen forums organized as part of the Strategic Rendez-Vous program.<br /><br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2007, the Executive Director of the Institute was appointed by the Government of Qu\u00e9bec to the position of Vice Chair of the Working Group on the Qu\u00e9bec Health System, an appointment stemming from the work carried out by the INM in 2005 on the reform of the Qu\u00e9bec health system. The results of the Institute\u2019s analyses and consultations were presented to the World Health Organization (WHO) which subsequently drew upon the INM\u2019s expertise for work the WHO carried out in collaboration with the Ministries of Health of Portugal and Tunisia.</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since 2006, the INM has worked closely with ACFAS (Association francophone pour le savoir, a French-language multidisciplinary learned society), to support its organization of conferences for exchanges and the advancement of research on the theme of citizen participation. Over this period, more than 250 researchers and practitioners have met and discussed their work and approaches to it.<br /><br />\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2005, the INM was awarded the Claire Bonenfant Prize for Citizenship, an honour bestowed by the Government of Qu\u00e9bec in recognition of the promotion of democratic values and citizenship education.<br /><br />Since the Institute\u2019s creation in 2003, its influence has increasingly come to be recognized outside Qu\u00e9bec as well as within the province. One example of this recognition was the fact that, in the three years between 2010 and 2012, the INM was responsible for organizing the World Assembly of Civicus, the Global Alliance for Citizen Participation, an annual forum attended by some 1,000 NGOs from all parts of the world.<br /><br />The Executive Director of the Institute is also a Fellow of the Carold Foundation for the advancement of citizenship in social change, at both the national and international levels, in addition to being a member of the Ashoka network of social entrepreneurs (a group that includes some 2,500 of the most outstanding social innovators in the world).<br /><br />\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "Montr\u00e9al", "tags": "public participation", "geo_province": "Quebec", "title_en":

It allows citizens to learn about and express their views on projects that could have repercussions on the environment and on their quality of life as well as on any question related to the quality of the environment. Projects include, among others, roads, landfill sites and industrial, electrical and energy-related projects.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marcel L\u00e9ger, Minister of the Environment under the first Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque government, is the lawmaker behind the creation of the BAPE in 1978. Mr L\u00e9ger wanted to entrust citizens with a positive role regarding the protection of their environment. He was influenced by the Ontarian legislation of the time. The neighbouring province had already been guaranteeing public participation in the environmental impact assessment procedure for a couple years when the Quebec went forward with the BAPE.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since its creation, the BAPE received about 850 mandates from the Minister. Around 65% of these mandates were limited to the holding of a public information and consultation period, 26% involved an inquiry and a public hearing, 5% an inquiry and mediation, and 4% involved only an inquiry. By the summer of 2013, the BAPE had released no less than 295 inquiry reports.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to the specific projects that have been entrusted to it, the BAPE held commissions on a number of key topics for Quebec society, such as hazardous waste management (1988-90), forest protection (1990-91), water management (1999-2000), pig production (2002-03) and the shale gas industry (2010-11).</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">COMPOSITION</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The BAPE is comprised of six full-time members, including a President and a Vice-President, both appointed by the Quebec government. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">When the Minister asks the BAPE to hold an inquiry and a public hearing, the President of the BAPE sets up a commission of inquiry and designates the person in charge. The person who chairs the commission is usually a full-time member of the BAPE and is assisted by commissioners chosen based on their expertise in relation to the specific elements and issues of the submitted project. The President can also resort to a list of part-time members appointed by the government.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">As commissioners, it is of note that members can require the attendance before them of any person whose evidence may be relevant to the subject of inquiry and can request any document that may be useful in understanding the file. The formal exercise of coercive powers that are officially available to a BAPE commission is, however, avoided wherever possible.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Commissioners must comply with the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct of the Members of the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement, a document of 38 articles regarding the general conduct, the duty of reserve and the independence of the commissioners. Among other provisions, the Code specificies that members \u201cshall avoid any situation involving a conflict of interest\u201d and \u201cconsider any attempt to interfere with their work as being unacceptable and intolerable\u201d.1</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The autonomous character of the BAPE and the independence of its commissioners is a crucial feature of the organization, and has been a constant matter of debate throughout the past few decades. Any nomination or event that raises doubt as to this independence is fiercely condemned by members of the opposition, environmental groups and the media.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This idea of a public, neutral, and independent organization has inspired other initiatives, such as the Commission nationale du d\u00e9bat public (CNDP), in France, and the Office de consultation publique de Montr\u00e9al (OCPM) in Quebec.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">PROCEDURE</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">To carry out this basic mission, the BAPE provides information, conducts inquiries and consults the public on projects or questions related to the quality of the environment submitted to the BAPE by the Minister. The BAPE then prepares inquiry reports on these files.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">1. Before the BAPE</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before a project is entrusted to the BAPE, it must make it through the following stages outlined by the Minister of Environment in order to comply with government requirements:</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the proponent notifies the Minister of its intention to carry out a project;</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the Minister indicates to the proponent, in a directive, the elements that must be found in the impact study: justification of the project, its impacts, its variants if any, the description of the natural and human environment, the planned mitigation measures, etc.;</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the proponent then carries out its impact study and submits it to the Minister*. </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minister specialists analyze, where necessary, if the impact study meets the requirements of the Minister\u2019s directive. Following this verification, the Department may ask the proponent to clarify certain aspects of its impact study before the latter is made public by the BAPE;</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 once the impact study is deemed sufficiently complete, the Minister is ready to entrust the BAPE with a first mandate, that of holding a public information and consultation period.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">*This impact study may include a social part, which generally results from a stakeholder consultation by the proponent. In this regard, public consultation often occurs before the BAPE comes in play. It can be seen as a positive side effect of the institution. Throughout the years, many proponents have begun to do upstream consultations in order to be better prepared for the BAPE hearings\u2026</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">2. Public information and consultation period</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The public information and consultation period consists of making public the impact study and the other documents pertaining to the project.\u00a0 The regulatory duration of this period is 45 days. During this period: </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the documentation on the project is published on the BAPE website and is made available at consultation centres in Montreal, Quebec city and the region affected by the project; the addresses and telephone numbers of the centres are disseminated by press release, public notices and posters; </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the BAPE holds an information session, which citizens from the community in question are invited to attend; at this session, the BAPE explains the procedure, the proponent presents its project, and citizens have the opportunity to ask questions; </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it is during this 45-day period that a person, a group, an organization or a municipality in favour of a public discussion and evaluation of the project can submit an application in writing to the Minister requesting a public hearing; </p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 once the information period is over, the BAPE prepares a report which it then sends to the Minister; this report is added to the documentation available to the public.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the end of an information period, if the Minister has received no request for a hearing, the role of the BAPE ends and the Department will continue its environmental analysis of the project. If the Minister receives a request for a hearing, unless he or she deems it frivolous (unfounded), he or she will then entrust the BAPE with a second mandate, namely that of holding a public hearing. In some cases, the Minister may entrust the BAPE with a mediation mandate, when he or she deems that the subject matter of the requests for a public hearing lends itself to such a mandate.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a name=\"d\u00e9roulement\" id=\"d\u00e9roulement\"></a> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">3. Public hearings</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The inquiry and public hearing process takes place over a period of no more than four months, and is divided into two parts. Upon receiving the mandate from the Minister, the BAPE Chairman sets up an inquiry commission composed of one or more commissioners.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the first part of the hearing, the commission holds public sessions in the region affected by the project. Both the proponent and the resource people identified by the commission are available to answer questions from the general public as well as from the commission. The number of sessions is determined by the commission, based on its own needs and those of the general public. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The end of the first part of the hearing and the beginning of the second part must be at least 21 days apart so that citizens have time to inform the commission secretariat that they intend to submit a brief or make a verbal presentation, and then to prepare their brief or verbal presentation. The second part of hearings is dedicated to those briefs and presentations.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The type of public hearings held by the BAPE is thus different from the traditional model of public hearings found elsewhere in Canada or in the United States. The traditional form of hearings is characterized by the holding of a public assembly led by municipal elected officials, who, on their own or with the help of public servants, present a planning project and then ask for citizens\u2019 opinions on the spot. A study in the United States shows that this type of public hearing generally lasts between a half hour and three hours.6</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The practice of the BAPE is distinguished by the facts that: 1) the public hearings are held by an independent organization that has the leeway to invite experts, to ask the developer of the project under examination for additional information and to ensure that citizens\u2019 questions and opinions have been clearly understood; and 2) particular attention is given to access to information, with the relevant documents available in several consultation centres and on the BAPE\u2019s website, and the holding of information sessions describing the project.7</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">4. Report</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">When the second part of the hearing is over, the commission drafts its inquiry and public hearing report. The BAPE then makes its report to the Minister, containing its observations and analysis. This must be done within four months from the beginning of the mandate. Most of the time, commissioners also transmit a series of recommendations, opinions and comments to the Minister. It was not originally mentioned in their mandate, but commissioners took the liberty to do so in the first hearings, and it has become an \u201cinstitutionalised\u201d practice today.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The commission\u2019s work ends at that point. After receiving the report from the BAPE, the Minister then has 60 days to release it to the general public. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Based on its own environmental analysis and on the report prepared by the BAPE, the Minister finally makes recommendations to the government, which in turn is responsible for making the final decision to authorize the project with or without changes on the conditions it determines, or to reject the project.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">CRITIQUES</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Many experts and scholars have observed the BAPE over the last decades. Clarity, concision, efficiency and credibility are among the qualities that are generally used to describe its procedure. The impartiality and independence of the commissions, as well as their non-judicial but consultative character are listed as characteristics to preserve. People also underline as strengths the openness of the inquiries and hearings, the easy access that is given to information and the power of initiative with which citizens are granted.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the other hand, however, people generally deplore that the public participation is limited to a single moment and comes often lately in the environmental impact assessment procedure. The conflictual and repetitive character of the hearings is also seen as a negative aspect of the BAPE. Finally, it appears that some proponents are better than others at adapting themselves to the procedure, so they are better able to take advantage of it.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, in the last 30 years, the BAPE have been a key player in defining a culture of public participation in the province of Quebec, to the extent that public consultation is naturally linked to environmental impact assessment in people minds today.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">QUICK FACTS</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Among the 60 projects examined by the BAPE from 2000 to 2005, 36% were projects from the private sector, 22% from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec (government-owned corporation), 22% from the Quebec Minister of Transport, 15% from other public agencies and 5% from public private partnerships.5</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Less than 100 participants attended 80% of those public hearings. Around 15% of the hearings were attended by 100 to 200 participants, and only one hearing was attended by more than 200.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Half of the 60 BAPE reports were favourable to the projects examined, 30% judged the project \u201cacceptable\u201d and 18,33% were unfavourable.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Among the projects examined, 88,33% were finally authorized subject to certain conditions by the Quebec government, and only 3% were completely refused.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Samuel Tremblay, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al</p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\">This paper is part of a research project funded by the SSHRC, calls \u2018Expertise, organizational field and the diffusion of public participation practices\u2019 (2012-2016) and directed by Laurence Bherer (Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al), Mario Gauthier (Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais) and Louis Simard (Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Ottawa).</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sources :</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[1] Site officiel du Bureau d\u2019audiences publiques sur l\u2019environnement, Online. http://<a href=\"http://www.bape.gouv.qc.ca/sections/english/\">www.bape.gouv.qc.ca/sections/english/</a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[2] Gauthier, Mario et Louis Simard (2007), \u00ab\u00a0Le BAPE et l\u2019institutionnalisation du d\u00e9bat public au Qu\u00e9bec\u00a0: mise en \u0153uvre et effets\u00a0\u00bb, in C\u00e9cile Blatrix et al.

It distinguishes itself by its consultation practices based on the concept of an independent, transparent and credible neutral third party.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In its first ten years of existence, the OCPM has held no less than 103 public consultations. Its mandate primarily involves urban and land-use planning projects under municipal jurisdiction, but is not limited to those matters1. For instance, consultations may pertain to the following areas:</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 shared or institutional equipment (hospital, university, regional park, etc.)</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 major infrastructure (airport, shunting yard, water treatment facility, etc.)</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a residential, commercial or industrial establishment situated in the business district</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a heritage site or site located in a historic and natural borough, a recognized historic monument or classified cultural property</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 draft municipal policies, visions or development</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, the OCPM does not have the power to initiate consultations on its own. Its mandates must necessarily come from the city council or the executive committee.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Consultations result in the publication of reports outlining the issues and positions expressed by the citizens. Analysis and recommendations are also formulated to municipal elected officials. The process has no decision-making capacity, but its formal and autonomous nature, as well as the good media coverage it gets, makes it difficult to ignore for the decision-makers. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, the Office has the mandate to propose rules to structure public consultation in Montr\u00e9al to ensure the implementation of credible, transparent and effective consultation mechanisms.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Genesis of the Office</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first formal public consultation structure appeared in the late 1980s in Montreal, with the creation of the Bureau de consultation de Montr\u00e9al (BCM). For five years, this organization held public consultations on issues submitted by city authorities. However, at that time, the existence of the BCM was closely linked to the political power in office, as it was constituted under a by-law adopted by the city council. Therefore, in 1994, the new Montr\u00e9al administration decided to abolish it by revoking the by-law. From then on, public consultations would be held by a single city council standing committee.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Over the years, it became clear that such a mechanism was not enough, and that a more neutral and detailed analysis was necessary for certain important projects. For citizens and groups interested in evaluating and improving a project, consultation proved useless when elected officials had already made up their minds about it.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Responding to critics and pressures from several sectors of civil society, the municipal administration created the Tremblay commission in 2000. This group of five members, led by G\u00e9rald Tremblay, was mandated to examine consultation practices pertaining to urban planning.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Tremblay commission held public hearings over the course of the summer of 2000. In its final report, it then set out a number of recommendations, including that to create an Office de consultation publique with a mandate and mission that would largely inspire the government in the creation of the Office as we know it today.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Office was finally created on January 1, 2002, at the same time as the new Ville de Montr\u00e9al following the amalgamation of the island\u2019s cities2. The inclusion of provisions creating the OCPM in the Charter of Ville de Montr\u00e9al ensured, at that moment, that changing political teams in Montr\u00e9al\u2019s administration would no longer jeopardize the existence of the Office.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Composition</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The OCPM today is composed of a president and 25 partial time or ad hoc commissioners (the position of full-time commissioner was abolished in August 2006, but remains an option under the provisions of the Charter). The commissioners are neither elected officials nor city employees; they are appointed for four years terms by city council by a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast. They are neutral and mandated to ensure that relevant information has been provided and understood, that all participants\u2019 questions have been asked and that all opinions have been heard. They must provide equal treatment to all.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Procedure</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A typical public consultation process begins with the Office receiving a mandate from the city council or executive committee. A public notice announcing the consultation is then</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">published in a daily newspaper at least 15 days prior to the first public session. During that period, a comprehensive dissemination and advertising strategy is implemented. Access to information is seen as crucial. All relevant documents are made available in several of the municipality\u2019s libraries and on the OCPM\u2019s website.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first part of the consultation then consists of one or more information sessions about the project. In these sessions, the developer and city officials present both the project and the required regulatory framework. These presentations are followed by a question period.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Three weeks later, citizens and organizations that have previously registered come to present their briefs or express their opinions before the commission. These sessions are open to the public. Briefs may also be filed without presentation at the meetings.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Following the consultation sessions, the commission deliberates. In light of the documents submitted for its consideration, questions asked, and opinions received, it drafts the public consultation report outlining the issues and positions expressed. Its analysis and recommendations to municipal elected officials are also included in the report.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">When the consultation report is ready, it is sent to the Mayor of Montr\u00e9al. Two weeks later, it is made public on the OCPM Website and submitted to the city council and executive committee.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A unique model</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The type of public hearings held in Montr\u00e9al is thus different from the traditional model of municipal public hearings found elsewhere in Canada or in the United States. The traditional form of hearings is characterized by the holding of a public assembly led by municipal elected officials, who, on their own or with the help of public servants, present a planning project and then ask for citizens\u2019 opinions on the spot. A study in the United States shows that this type of public hearing generally lasts between a half hour and three hours3.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The practice in Montr\u00e9al is distinguished by the facts that: 1) the public hearings are held by an independent organization that has the leeway to invite experts, to ask the developer of the project under examination for additional information and to ensure that citizens\u2019 questions and opinions have been clearly understood; and 2) particular attention is given to access to information, with the relevant documents available in several of the municipality\u2019s libraries and on the OCPM\u2019s website, and the holding of evening information sessions describing the project, before citizens voice their opinions after a 15-day delay following the end of the information phase. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Quick facts</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In its first ten years of activities, the OCPM received about 2000 briefs and opinions. More than one third of those briefs came from individual citizens. About 25,000 people attended its hearings.</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to a poll realized for the 10th anniversary of the Office, one Montrealer out of five knew what the OCPM was in 2012.

We are working to transform how people envision democracy, and to develop innovative ways for even the largest organizations, communities, and governments to be truly democratic\u2014not just in theory or in name, but in practice.</p><h3>Our Approach</h3><p>Founded in 2013,<em><strong> </strong>Democracy In Practice</em> helps transform open-minded groups and communities into laboratories of democratic innovation where new approaches to governance can be experimented with and developed. We then share the insights and ideas generated by this experimentation to inspire others to see democracy in new ways. By putting into practice more inclusive and participative forms of government, we also work on a social level to foster individuals that are both engaged and capable of working with those different from themselves. We believe this underpins not only the political change <em>toward </em>a better democracy, but also the long-term success of <em>democracy itself</em>.</p><h3>Current Projects</h3>Democratic experimentation is currently underway in the student governments of three schools in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Typically, student governance mirrors the basic structure of adult governance: a few students seek nomination, run one-day campaigns, and hold elections. After the votes are cast, the vast majority of students are excluded from further participation. Instead, <em>Democracy In Practice</em> is helping students \u2013 in their first encounter with \u2018democracy\u2019 \u2013 experiment with new approaches that are more inclusive, representative, and effective.\u00a0One such approach involves random selection and rotation. In these schools we\u2019ve replaced candidates and elections with lotteries in which students are randomly selected to assume temporary positions within the student government. After limited terms, these students rotate out and are replaced by other randomly selected students so that, over time, all students (even the shyest and least popular among them) have the chance to work as part of a team, assume responsibilities, and serve their peers and school as student-leaders. Combining random selection with rotation ensures that the student governments broadly represent the diversity within each student body (e.g. gender, age, and ethnic differences) instead of a single clique or type of student, and allows more students to participate directly.\u00a0Putting these innovative approaches to the test means encouraging and empowering students to improve their school community in concrete ways that they identify. To that effect, we\u2019ve seen randomly selected student governments organize fun events such as school-wide field trips and theater competitions, as well as address complex problems like the need for more sustainable waste-disposal systems, the lack of a school library, and the high cost of transportation to and from school.\u00a0Beyond tackling challenging issues within the structure of these new approaches to government, we\u2019re also pushing students to take ownership of the design itself, direct the experimentation with different democratic practices and processes themselves, and develop their own original ideas.\u00a0<h3>Cases</h3>See a case study of our first year of projects here: <a href=\"http://www.participedia.net/en/cases/democracy-practice-democratic-student-government-program-cochabamba-bolivia\">www.participedia.net/en/cases/democracy-practice-democratic-student-gove...</a><h3>External Links</h3><p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.democracyinpractice.org\">www.democracyinpractice.org</a></p><p>Twitter: @deminpractice</p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/democracyinpractice\">www.instagram.com/democracyinpractice</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/deminpractice\">www.facebook.com/deminpractice</a></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/democracy-in-practice\">www.linkedin.com/company/democracy-in-practice</a></p><p>Vimeo: <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/democracyinpractice\">www.vimeo.com/democracyinpractice</a></p><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "Cochabamba", "tags": "Democratic Experimentation", "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Democracy In Practice", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/democracy-practice", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "17\u00b0 22' 59.9988\" S", "additional": "", "author_uid": "69307", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "66\u00b0 10' 0.0012\" W", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"New%20Logo%20Update.png\", \"title\": \"Democracy In Practice Logo\"}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2015-06-11T21:14:37", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2014-02-22T09:00:06", "other_images": "[\"logo.png\"]", "content_language": "English||Italiano - Italian", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "2017", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "Tecnologie Democratiche", "geo_country": "Italy", "content_country": "Italy", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Community Development||Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)||Science &amp; Technology", "body_en": "<p>\u00a0</p><h2>Mission and purpose</h2><p>In the political arena and by the citizen, the Internet is increasingly perceived as potential instrument for the democratic participation; however, few and undeveloped are the web platforms conceived to help parties and political movement to involve citizens in the preparation of programs and policy proposals.</p><p>The association \"Tecnologie Democratiche\" (\"Democratic Technologies\" ndr.) was created to satisfy this need, providing an enhanced tool to exploit the \"collective intelligence\", the skills and experiences of citizens, their creativity, their critical spirit, while ensuring at the same time democratic values in the various stages of the elaboration of a policy proposal.</p><h2>Principles that guide us</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Participation</strong><br />Directly Involve citizens to bring more energy and different points of view.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Transparency and Security</strong><br />Without transparency, the rules can be easily circumvented, it also means openness and ability to accommodate.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Constructive Dialogue</strong><br />With proper instruments, develop ideas simultaneously by more hands may result more productive than doing it yourself.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Equity</strong><br />Equity means effective equality of opportunity.

We all hear about the economy, and about political and social debates regarding climate change, and the effect of money in politics, and that sort of thing... Without getting \"too political,\" it seems to me that the economic system, which relies on faster and faster growth and increased productivity, may be running into natural limits when it comes to what the natural environment can handle, as well as the capacity of workers to handle increased levels of productivity (while wages remain stagnant).<br />\u00a0<br />Regardless of where you are in the political spectrum when it comes to these issues, I think that the reason we hear more and more references to sustainability (in economics, in the workplace, in food production, in business, in consumption) is because a growing number of people are realizing that the demands of the current system (based on the financialization of the productive sector) is unsustainable, and, as this realization spreads, a consensus is starting to build around the need to slow things down a bit and reexamine the meaning of success, happiness, and need.<br /><br />So, as I thought about it, I came up with an idea: About launching a website/program/project specifically designed to promote sustainable economic practices?\u00a0 So I decided on a name, MyCityMarket.net.<br /><br />Here's what I have so far regarding the mission: A <strong>think tank</strong> and/or <strong>business incubator</strong> focused on promoting sustainable economic practices, locally-owned (small) businesses, the arts, music, civics, volunteering, and non-traditional business enterprises, including cooperatives, employee-owned businesses, and benefit corporations.<br />\u00a0<br />I'm very interested in <strong><a href=\"http://www.mycitymarket.net/index.php/contact\">hearing from people</a></strong> who have also been thinking about these things and would like to share ideas and/or provide feedback or assistance.</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": "local self-reliance||local economy||small business||democracy||Participatory democracy||Social Media||shop local", "geo_province": "", "title_en": "My City Market", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/my-city-market", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "69265", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"logo_3.png\", \"title\": \"My City Market\"}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2015-02-22T18:50:21", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2014-12-23T21:55:48", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4173", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Human Rights||Law Enforcement, Criminal Justice, &amp; Corrections||International Aid &amp; Development||Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)", "body_en": "<p>History</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>MoveOn was founded by the married couple Joan Blades and Wes Boyd during the Lewinsky affair in the late 1990s. Tired of scandal-focused politics, they started a web site providing a petition addressed to Congress, to censure Clinton\u2018s behaviour but to continue working on serious political issues. Within a week the petition was subscribed to by more than 100.000 people. Nevertheless, Congress didn\u2018t react to the petition though MoveOn gained some medial attention.</p><p>After the Lewinsky affair MoveOn possessed a great email list, but missed a main purpose. This situation changed with the terror attacks of 11 September 2001 and the following war against terrorism. It fused with the mailing list of Eli Pariser by making him the executive director. His list, 9-11.org, was as big as the one of MoveOn, and together they became the leading voice in the anti war movement and an important progressive political actor. It gave significant support to Barack Obama\u2018s election campaign, carried out other political projects and developed new opportunities of participation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Organisation</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Move on is based on it\u2018s enormous number of members. As it\u2018s mails are received by 4.5 million people, it can generate powerful action, if just a small part of the recipients read the email and even a smaller part can be engaged to really take action.</p><p>There also exist 250 MoveOn Councils which consist of a minimum of four MoveOn members and work on local issues and organize physical actions. Council members gain a certain reputation within the organisation, but after the election of Obama they got less important.</p><p>In contrast to it\u2018s great corpus of members it\u2018s internal bureaucratic structure is rigorously minimalistic. There are 19 people working full time on the emails and the analysis of member data but there is no physical office in order to avoid any infrastructure costs. Besides the 19 employees there are eleven field organizers who support the work of the councils.</p><p>So in contrast to many other interest group organisations MoveOn dispenses to employ scientists, specialists or lobbyists who focus on a specific topic to directly influence the political process or debate. Instead it is formed as a generalist organisation without a special topic but with progressive political attitudes, which allows MoveOn to work on a range of different topics, and so to succesfully address a wide range of people.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Functioning</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>As MoveOn is a generalist organisation it works with a great membership on many different topics. It is essential to have such a big mailing list as not everyone is interested in every topic, and even not everyone interested can be encouraged to take action. But as there are so many people receiving the mails, there remain enough people to react and generate effective action.</p><p>The role of the internet as a medium for information for this kind of organisation is important, as there is almost no relation between the costs and the number of recipients. So the internet enabled MoveOn to become a generalist, and MoveOn itself understood the new rules of online communication to build up an efficient organisation by redefining the concept of membership. A MoveOn member needs to do almost nothing apart from reading some of the received emails and to participate once a year or even less. The crucial point is that inactivity doesn\u2018t harm the efficience or effectiveness of the organisation anymore, as it would have been if it sent physical letters or if there was an unreliable member in a group. Instead, even someone who had not taken action for years still offers the chance to participate and give a valuable contribution. And if not, he or she still didn\u2018t cost anything.</p><p>But next to it\u2018s bare size, there are different factors making MoveOn a succesfull actor. It does not send too many emails to not make anyone perceive them as spam. And not every member gets every email. MoveOn analyses it\u2018s members by the projects they participate or donate, so if there is a special issue which fits an appropriate group just these members will receive the email. This way, people with special interests stay informed and can participate in theses topics, without sending too many emails. But there are also emails sent to all of the members, to use the full potential of the large mailing list.</p><p>Furthermore, MoveOn pretests it\u2018s emails according to scientific standards. To do so it sends different versions of an email to a small but representative group of members and analyses the outcome, e.g. in terms of open rates and clickthrough rates. Afterwards, MoveOn sends an optimized email with the best chances to appeal to the addressees and make them take action.</p><p>Also the point of time for MoveOn is an important variable to reach the best effect. It\u2018s gearded to the daily media and sends emails relating to current issues. So the people are familiar with the topic and are interested already. This increases the chance to create action. Also everyone gets encouraged as it is emphasized that even small donations are a valuable contribution.</p><p>In addition, MoveOn asks its members which topics they are interested in and integrates them into the communication process. For example, it held a contest between the members who could send in a video with the title \u201eBush in 30 seconds\u201c. The members also voted on which was the best one and as a result MoveOn gained the best video to address its audience. Of course a video originating in such a process has a highly viral potential. Virality is another important factor which helps MoveOn to generate 500.000 new members each year.</p><p>Overall MoveOn appears to be the prototype of a new modern internet based not for profit organisation as it managed to optimize it\u2018s techniques of communication for the digital media. It redefined the concept of membership, reduced to receiving mails and occasionally participation. This enabeled MoveOn to become a great and succesfull generalist organisation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Importance</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>MoveOn became an important political actor as its not just the biggest interest group today, but outperforms every participatory group ever appeared in the United States. It managed to generate large amounts of money and other ressources to support political parties or other organisations and so exert influence on politics and society.</p><p>MoveOn changed the mode people participate in politics as its concept of a giant online based generalist organisation appears to be a disruptive innovation in the sector of citizen participation. Karpf compares its effect in the world of participation with the significance Amazon.com had on the book trade (Karpf, 2009).</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Examples</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>MoveOn supported Barack Obamas campaign during the elections in 2008. It collected 88 million dollars and more than 900.000 volunteers worked for more than 20 million hours to support Obama. Again MoveOn proceeded quite strategically and organized a campaign called \u201eCall for Change\u201c, demonstrating flexibility and creativity. As the areas who mostly supported the democrats also contained many MoveOn members and councils, areas less supporting the democrats contained less members to work for the campaign. So the \u201eCall for Change\u201c participants in the democrat dominated regions got telephone lists of the battleground states, and so promoted Obama in those regions, where the decision was ambiguous.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Another project demonstrating MoveOn\u2018s strategical procedure is the donation campaign for different progressive organisations betrayed by Bernard Maddof, a Wall Street financier. The issue was in the media so everyone knew about the background. And as there where different organisations scammed, a wide range of people with different interests could be effectively addressed. Furthermore MoveOn found two organisations which matched every donated dollar with one dollar, but just if the donation came in within a short deadline. So the people knew about the issue, most probably knew about an organisation they liked benefiting from the donations and really where motivated to donate immediately.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Source</strong></p><p>Karpf, D., 2009.

The project is carried out at the Department of Political Science and Contemporary History at the University of Turku.</p><h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>Research question 1: How widely are democratic innovations used in Finland?<br />RQ 2: How democratic innovations affect and are perceived in policy processes?<br />RQ 3: Does the use of democratic innovations increase legitimacy of the decision-making?<br />RQ 4: What kinds of civil society actors and individuals have taken advantage of the new possibilities for participation at the national level?<br />RQ 5: How can the use of democratic innovations be modified to improve the quality of Finnish democracy?</p><p>By the end of year 2016 the research team led by prof. Maija Set\u00e4l\u00e4 hopes to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how democratic innovations can help improve the functioning of the representative democracy both from the perspective of decision-makers and citizens. This includes identifying what the main obstacles are for realizing the potential benefits promised by the democratic innovations and how these can best be achieved. These results are given out on several channels, including peer-reviewed articles, a final report, a closing seminar and popularized writings.</p><h3>History and background</h3><p>The interest in democratic innovations has increased also in Finland, although from a comparative perspective Finland has been a cautious user of democratic innovations. At the national level, advisory referendums have been constitutionally provided since 1987, and the institution of citizens\u2019 initiative was adopted in 2012. This new instrument has raised a lot of interest and public debate in Finland. In a comparative perspective (Set\u00e4l\u00e4 &amp; Schiller 2012), the Finnish system of citizens\u2019 initiatives has certain specific characteristics. First, the possibility for collecting signatures online on <a href=\"http://www.kansalaisaloite.fi\">www.kansalaisaloite.fi</a> is relatively unique in the world. It is also possible for non-state actors to organize the collection of signatures online. Second, the decision made in Spring 2012 to use open committee hearings in conjunction with citizens\u2019 initiatives can potentially increase the overall transparency of parliamentary proceedings. In addition, deliberative mini-publics and crowdsourcing have also been tested at the national level.<br /><br />At the local level, the repertoire of democratic innovations is larger. Instruments of advisory municipal referendum, agenda initiatives and initiatives for an advisory referendum have been provided in the municipal law since 1990. Different forms of discursive participation, such as citizen juries, citizen committees, public hearings and online platforms are used in many municipalities. In a comparative perspective, democratic innovations are most widely used at the local level (Newton &amp; Geissel 2012). In the area of local public administration the interest in new forms of participation has increased especially because of municipal mergers and New Public Management. Traditionally strong local autonomy, however, makes Finland a special case together with other Nordic countries. There is not much legislation obliging municipalities to consult and engage citizens outside elections, and the Local government act only recommends how citizens could be engaged in the decision-making, resulting thus in great variance in the actual use of democratic innovations across municipalities. The local political context is therefore more crucial for political equality in Finland than in many other countries exploring forms of civic participation.<br /><br />Finland is, however, still predominantly a representative democracy in the sense that the formal decision-making power always remains within representative institutions. In this respect, it is uncertain whether the use of democratic innovations has changed the patterns of power-sharing in Finland.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Research questions are answered by analysing a set of different materials with both quantitative and qualitative methods. As part of the project new datasets will be gathered on subjects and use of the different forms of participation on national and local level. Several surveys will be conducted on the participators themselves.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>Upcoming closing seminar in the fall of 2016 in Helsinki, Finland.

The platform facilitates a two-way communication between the city and its citizens. Citizens post ideas, discuss them with each other and upvote the best ideas \u2014 in a fun and easy accessible way. On the other hand, the city uses CitizenLab to consult the opinion of its citizens via polling or to ask their creative solutions to an existing problem. Our SaaS solution helps cities to tap into the collective intelligence of the citizens and become more responsive to their citizens\u2019 needs.<h6>About Our Product</h6>Our citizensourcing software is ready-to-use, yet fully customisable in an easy-to-use admin panel. The city can easily change the design of the platform, as well as pick its language out of already more than 20 available languages. The platform stands out by its user-friendly design, making it possible for every citizen to participate. We work with clean cards, different categories and an intuitive user interface on both desktop and mobile \u2014 submitting, commenting or upvoting is never more than two clicks away.<p>\u00a0</p>Next to that, we make use of gamification in order to incentivise the citizens. Every time their posts or comments get upvoted, they will earn points (resulting in new badges) and will move up in the citizen leaderboard. The city gets quantified insights on which citizens are most engaged and can reward them for their valuable input with real-life benefits. Those citizens analytics are not only coming from our platform; we\u2019re ready to integrate with any other product in order to give cities a one-stop portal to get insights on their citizens\u2019 needs.<h6>Mission and Purpose</h6>CitizenLab aims at making tomorrow\u2019s governments more citizen-centric, through their user-friendly cloud software, insightful data analytics and focus on mobile.\u00a0Citizens do want to engage, but lack the means to do it in an easy accessible way. Today\u2019s citizen participation possibilities in cities are limited to bureaucratic \"pen and paper\" forms, time-consuming in-person visits and town halls meetings, and a single vote every X years. Don\u2019t get us wrong: they should stay in place, but existing technologies make it possible to create an interaction between city and citizens that is less time-consuming, is much cheaper and reaches a wider audience.\u00a0It\u2019s our ultimate goal at CitizenLab to make the most user-friendly cloud software for cities to get closer to their citizens. We take a data-driven approach in order to provide cities with the most insightful analytics on their citizens. CitizenLab wants to help cities to not only become reactive to their citizens\u2019 needs, but also predictive. We\u2019re sure that time is right for governments to adopt cloud software that helps them unlock the collective brainpower of their citizens, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.<h3>History</h3>CitizenLab got started in July 2015, by the founders Wietse Van Ransbeeck (22) and Aline Muylaert (22).\u00a0<h3>Funding</h3><p>Incubated by the Belgian accelerator iMinds with 25k EUR in funding.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://citizenlab.co\">http://citizenlab.co</a></p><h3>\u00a0</h3>", "geo_city": "Brussels", "tags": "platform||software||gamification||co-creation||civic engagement||civic tech", "geo_province": "", "title_en": "CitizenLab", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/citizenlab", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "117485", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"logo_name_0.png\", \"title\": \"CitizenLab logo\"}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2016-02-03T16:09:29", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2016-02-03T16:09:29", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4306", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Canada", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Economic Development||Community Development||Environment", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>Communica\u2019s experienced communication team provides clients with a full range of strategic services to achieve effective communication across all business units.

It has five main aims: 1) to be a welcoming community for members of all views, 2) to inspire healthy debate for mutual growth, 3) to encourage youth engagement in politics, 4) to give information to youth people who want to be more involved in politics, and 5) to have its debates influence mainstream politics.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">YouthDebates is largely a non-profit. It was founded by Alexander Firth, who started it primarily for the UK. He was joined by Ryan Chatt, who become the Public Relations Director after the launch. YouthDebates expanded outside of the UK starting in August 2014. However, it does use advertisements and a premium membership option to pay for costs of website maintenance, running the organization, and publicity of the site. There are no fees to participating on the site. The site also accepts standard donations.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Participant Selection</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Any youth can participate by going to YouthDebates.org. The site is divided into a British Politics Forum, American Politics Forum, Irish Politics Forum, Canadian Politics Forum, Australian Politics Forum, New Zealand Politics Forum, South African Politics Forum, and Indian Politics Forum. YouthDebates also includes an information section on British and American voting as well as various other resources and media items for a multiplicity of nationalities. Youth can blog about issues as well. \u00a0Also, the Atlantis Senate was introduced as a political role-playing game, giving youth the ability to control their own politician in a senate/parliamentary setting.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">YouthDebates.Org is largely an online political forum, so it is by nature a collaborative and deliberative public endeavor. YouthDebates wanted to provide a forum for all youth to be able to \u201cvent their political views\u201d on issues affecting us.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Since its founding in 2014, YouthDebates has had 190,000+ posts, 9000+ debates, and 3300+ registered individuals participating in the debate forums. The page has received over 39,000 likes on Facebook.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite its intention to become an internationally popular site, the majority of users of YouthDebates.Org are from the UK and are aged 13 to 25. There are growing bases in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Secondary Sources</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/youthdebates\">http://participedia.net/en/cases/youthdebates</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/youthdebates\">https://www.patreon.com/youthdebates</a></p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">External Links</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://youthdebates.org/\">http://youthdebates.org/</a></p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "YouthDebates.Org", "methods": "Online deliberation", "path": "/organizations/youthdebatesorg", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "110904", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2016-02-04T16:13:55", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2016-02-04T16:13:55", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4310", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Children &amp; Youth||Identity &amp; Diversity", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>UNITY was founded to cultivate strong, self-reliant Native youth that will be assets to their communities as involved civic members. It also serves as a forum for discussion about problems facing both the individual indigenous peoples and the larger Native American community. Through sharing their experiences and encouraging each other to grow as citizens of their democracies, UNITY trains Native students to develop leadership skills that will allow each to become a representative voice in their nation.\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>Founded in 1976 by J.R. Cook, a Cherokee from Oklahoma, UNITY evolved from a small group of passionate students who attended programming in southwestern Oklahoma to the national networking organization that hosts semi-annual conferences attended by youth councils from 35 states and Canada. J.R. Cook initially founded a dropout prevention, mentoring, and cultural retention organization, catering specifically to 10 public schools in Oklahoma. However, in 1976, due to the organization's success at building member's self-esteem, it was transformed from a regional to a national organization, gaining non-profit incorporated status.\u00a0</p><p>At the UNITY conference in 1980 in Great Falls, Montana, the attendees pledged to refocus the organization to increase Native youth participation in government decision making and economic development. They published a \"Declaration for Independence\" in order to publicly take charge of their decisions and lives, which gained UNITY national recognition after Paul Harvey's commentary.\u00a0</p><p>Today, UNITY is focused on facilitating a cross-tribal dialogue regarding community improvement, cultural retention, youth education, and healthy lifestyle campaigns on reservations. It reaches over 50,000 Native youth from more than 220 youth councils.\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "United National Indian Youth (UNITY)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/united-national-indian-youth-unity", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "110904", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2016-02-04T16:41:59", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Helen Clark ", "post_date": "2016-02-04T16:41:59", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4312", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "International", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "International Aid &amp; Development", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>UNDP works in some 170 countries and territories, helping to achieve the eradication of poverty, and the reduction of inequalities and exclusion.

The initial idea behind Grassroots Jerusalem was to provide a space for Palestinian activists to exchange, coordinate and deliberate. Secondly, the founders understood that Palestinian community voices in Jerusalem are not heard on political levels. In 2011,\u00a0<em>Grassroots\u00a0</em>opened the\u00a0<em>Markaz Al Kul</em>\u00a0(Centre for All) community center in Sheikh Jarrah, an East Jerusalem neighborhood, with the support of Dan Church Aid and the European Commission.\u00a0<em>Grassroots\u00a0</em>quickly established lasting partnerships with over half the Palestinian communities in Jerusalem, building strong relationships with leaders and community-based organizations (CBOs). Since 2011, new community maps have been designed and visions and implementation plans have been developed within each partner community. An online information source for the coordination of humanitarian development and advocacy was implemented and a \u2018Legal Clinic\u2019, providing legal advice for Palestinian Jersualemites, was established. In 2013, the NGO expanded and moved into its present political community center which it named\u00a0<em>AlMarsa</em>\u00a0- The Harbour.</p><p>Despite its Israeli-Palestinian founding figures,\u00a0<em>Grassroots</em>\u00a0is a Palestinian organization working with Palestinian communities only. The rationale is that peaceful co-existence is an unworkable idea in a situation of occupation and continuous dispossession. Co-existence in that sense invites the occupied to acquiesce to their situation of rightlessness. Regarding the idea of co-existence as a normalization of the occupation,\u00a0<em>Grassroots</em>\u00a0discourse, accordingly, strongly prioritizes freedom and ending the occupation. Grassroots Jerusalem pursues a set of interrelated strategies to pursue this goal. In the following, the article focuses on one cornerstone of the NGO\u2019s work, which, via participatory mapping, narrative self-representation and agenda-setting, seeks to put Palestine Jerusalem on the geographical, social and political maps of those who have a stake in the future of the city.</p><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/participatory-politics-grassroots-jerusalem\">http://participedia.net/en/cases/participatory-politics-grassroots-jerus...</a></p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "East Jerusalem", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Grassroots Jerusalem", "methods": "Citizen Dialogue||Crowdsourcing", "path": "/organizations/grassroots-jerusalem", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "110904", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2016-02-18T16:49:12", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "1255 23rd Street, NW<br />Suite 275", "executive_director": "Stephen D\u2019Esposito and Dave Baker", "post_date": "2016-02-18T16:49:12", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "20037", "id": "4325", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "United States", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Economic Development||Environment||Health||Science &amp; Technology", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>RESOLVE builds strong, enduring solutions to environmental, social, and health challenges.

The course focuses on the design of collective spaces in collaboration with its inhabitants. Students learn from the experience people gained in the spaces they inhabit and take into account their needs, aspirations and expertise as make proposals to transform existing spaces. At the same time, community members receive some technical and design knowledge from the students, and this knowledge helps them to continue maintaining and developing the spaces in which they reside. On the other hand, the students, taking into account the requirements of the inhabitants, establish guidelines to design spaces for collective use that reflect the identity of the community.</p><p>The name \u201cCollaboration\u201d is used for this studio because, unlike \u201cParticipation\u201d, it suggests equal conditions in the work to be performed by all involved. Therefore, a project is not just for the community but is done with the community.\u00a0</p>Keeping this in mind, students are required to observe how spaces in a community are inhabited, to find out patterns of behaviour in them and to derive spatial qualities from these patterns. Then, they have to design a process of dialogue or interaction with residents to exchange information about the spaces and know their needs and ideas. This process should be interactive, inclusive, with images and even playful so that the largest number of people gets involved. After getting the inputs from the residents, students have to make design proposals consulting every idea with the residents. Finally, they have to build part of the project together with the community. This methodology based on observing and discussing, designing and building with the community helps to bridge the gap between academy and practice.<p>\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>El prop\u00f3sito de este taller es acercar a estudiantes de arquitectura, arquitectura paisajista, urbanismo, planificaci\u00f3n, dise\u00f1o e ingenier\u00eda a la realidad de las personas que habitan y utilizan los espacios que proyectan en un entorno colectivo.

Volunteers from different disciplines such as design, graphic design, urban planning, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering or sociology, and mostly college students designed and developed a participatory process (using photomontages, images, clue words and questions) to help residents of Buena Vista \u2013one of Santurce\u2019s neighborhood to communicate their necessities. The end result; residents and volunteers painted all the houses of the street #1 - with the colors they chosen, they built site specific urban furniture and created a garden in an underground landfill using recycled materials.</p><p>The second project of the studio was an initiative of the School of Architecture at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico carried out in 2013. Students helped residents of Alto del Cabro neighborhood, in San Juan, to improve unused and depraved spaces. In this particular situation, there was no support from other organizations. Students designed a participatory process to acquire ideas together with the residents. This participatory process included a blackboard where residents could write their aspirations regarding the neighborhood and a puzzle game with which they could explore and identify opportunities for development.</p><p>The third project took place in 2014. It was an initiative of the Municipality of San Juan to revitalize an abandoned bridge in the Tras Talleres neighborhood. It was in Tras Talleres that the trains that used to traversed the island with goods and passengers were repaired. Students devised an interactive timeline in which residents of the nearby neighborhood could display their memories of the train (oral history) and a map in which they identified -applying the elements of Kevin Lynch, trails, edges, districts, nodes and landmarks nearby the bridge. With this information, students made a preliminary design, highlighting the bridge as landmark, portal and meeting place.</p><p>A fourth project carried out in 2015 emerged from an initiative with the community association \u201cMachuchal Revive\u201d in San Juan. One of the main goals of the association was to rescue an abandoned house, called Casa Taft 169 (because of its location in Taft Street #169). The Casa was to be converted into a civic center. Students created four game booths, which residents visited to express their ideas for the development of the civic center. Then, they made an architectural model of the house with interchangeable parts that could be combined in different ways by the participants. Finally, students built two of the proposed interventions with the help of community members; a wall in the backyard, which separates the neighboring yard, and a door that facilitates access to the house.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>El taller fue fundado en el a\u00f1o 2012 por la profesora y doctora en arquitectura Omayra Rivera Crespo en San Juan, Puerto Rico.

It monitors government progress in this regard, particularly to ensure access for the poor and vulnerable populations. Their mission is to work towards a South Africa where the constitution is upheld and human rights are recognized in law and respected in practice and the government is accountable and responsive to the people.\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The organisation has a long history of working against injustice in the country. The Black Sash was established in 1955 by a small group of white middle-class women (who were predominantly English-speaking) when they formed an organization called The Women's Defence of the Constitution League. Founder members were Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton-Thompson (among others). The organisation was formed as a protest to oppose the Senate Bill that aimed to remove coloureds from the common voter\u2019s role as the women of Black Sash believed this action was against the \u2018spirit of the constitution. Though the organisation was established as means to highlight the unconstitutional actions taken by the apartheid government, it became a platform for liberal women to oppose the apartheid policies through protests, marches and vigils. The name Black Sash originated from the women\u2019s use of black sashes as a symbol to mourn the death of the constitution.\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>The organisation currently works in three main areas, rights-based information, education and training, community monitoring, and advocacy in partnership. The Black Sash publishes historical archives and activities from their advice offices and fieldwork activities as part of their educational campaigns. Black Sash has advice offices across the country, including a helpline where the public can ask questions on any matter regarding human rights. Their activities include advocacy work, where they engage government on behalf of communities, as well as monitoring government action in terms of ensuring access to rights. Their first advice office was opened in Cape Town during apartheid in an effort to assist victims of apartheid legislation within lawful means. The organisation\u2019s activities continue to help communities across South Africa.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>The Black Sash has been involved in a variety of projects, including: Community Monitoring and Advocacy, Reproductive Maternal and Child Health projects, and the Making All Voices Count pilot project to mention a few. The Community Monitoring and Advocacy project was implemented by driven communities through civil society organisations, who supported and trained volunteers as monitors in the project. The project identified the South African Social Security Agency, Department of Health, Department of Home Affairs and municipalities for monitoring.</p><p>The purpose of the Reproductive Maternal and Child Health project is to assist government in ensuring access to reproductive healthcare services and improve the quality of service particularly for the poor. The project aims to:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Support districts to oversee improvement of MNCH services.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthen delivery of school health, ward-based primary health care, and obstetric and neonatal emergency services.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Improve demand and accountability for MNCH services.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Document and disseminate new knowledge to remove barriers to the \u00a0 uptake and access to MNCH services.</p><p>The Making All Voices Count project is part of a global initiative which aims to empower Community Based Organisations to take ownership of and participate actively in citizen-based monitoring of three government services in 20 service sites across South Africa. The aim of the project is to monitor the rendering of government services from the perspective of ordinary people in an effort to promote better service standards. \u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/black-sash\">http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/black-sash</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash/about-the-black-sash</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/community-monitoring-and-advocacy-programme\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/community-monitoring-and-advocacy-programme</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/reproductive-mother-and-child-health\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/reproductive-mother-and-child-health</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/making-all-voices-count\">http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/sash-in-action/making-all-voices-count</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Black Sash", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/black-sash", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "33\u00b0 56' 41.5824\" S", "additional": "", "author_uid": "147792", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "18\u00b0 36' 14.9184\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2016-05-03T11:44:59", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2016-05-03T11:36:15", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4358", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p>\u00a0</p><h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>Code for South Africa is a civic coding organisation that believes in the usefulness of data and data sharing.

The programme is aimed at encouraging citizen engagement and accountable governance. The programme is about promoting transparency, fighting corruption, empowering citizens, and harnessing the power of new technologies to make government more effective and accountable. Making All Voices Count\u2019s goal is advancing the needs of citizens through engagements with government that ensure citizen participation for the promotion of a government that is effective listens to the people. Ultimately, Making All Voices Count intends to foster changes that allow all people, including the poor and marginalised, to engage with public and private institutions and call them to account over the issues that matter to them most. The programme aims to make progress and develop capacity to ensure active citizenship that generates results.\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>Making All Voices Count programme started in June 2013 and will run until 2017. It is managed by a group of three partners with offices in South Africa, Kenya, the United Kikndom, the Netherlands and Indonesia. The programme is a partnership between: Hivos (an international non-governmental organisation supporting people who are systematically blocked from rights, opportunities and resources), Ushahidi (a group pioneering technology-for-development organisation) and the Institute for Development Studies (a global institution for development research, teaching and learning, and impact and communications, based at the University of Sussex in the UK). Making All Voices Count works in 12 countries in Africa and Asia, primarily in Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, the Philippines, South Africa and Tanzania. The program was initiated with a clearly defined set of aims, a theory of change and a structure centred on four linked components \u2013 innovation, scaling, research and evidence, and catalysing global action. The programme has carried out activities under each of components.\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Making All Voices Count supports creative and cutting-edge solutions \u2013 many of which use mobile and web technology \u2013 to the challenge of amplifying citizen voices and enabling governments to listen and respond. The programme uses technology to advance the development and empowerment of citizens to actively engage with government and other entities. Their activities include:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Making grants to support innovation and technology that has the potential to support better governance.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conducting research that helps to build a base of evidence about what works and why in using innovation for accountable governance.</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Working with policy makers, opinion formers and influencers to ensure that our learning contributes has impact across the sector.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>Making All Voices Count is involved in a range of projects across the globe that are aimed at improving citizen engagement and government responsiveness. These projects include: Action Voices (aimed at improving communication between communities and local government in Ghana), The Engine room (which is used for improving the selection and use of ICT tools for accountable governance in Kenya and South Africa), Commission for Human Rights and Good Governance (a project in Tanzania that uses mobile phones to provide users with information on government budgets and spending, and enabling them to provide feedback), Citizen\u2019s Justice Network (which assists in educating communities with radio journalism in South Africa) and many other projects.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/about/\">http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/about/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RE-strategy.pdf\">http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RE-strategy.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RE-strategy.pdf\">http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RE-strategy.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Making-All-Voices-Count-Strategy-Synthesis.pdf\">http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Making-All-Voices-Count-Strategy-Synthesis.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/project/\">http://www.makingallvoicescount.org/project/</a></p><h3>\u00a0</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Making All Voices Count (MAVC)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/making-all-voices-count-mavc", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "147792", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2016-05-03T11:53:27", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2016-05-03T11:53:27", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4360", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p>\u00a0</p><h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>The Social Justice Coalition is a membership based social movement that works to promote and protect the enjoyment of the rights established in the South African Constitution, particularly socio-economic rights. Their purpose is to ensure equal access and quality of service. The movement\u2019s aim has been to advance the constitutional rights to life, dignity, equality, freedom and safety for all people, but especially those living in informal settlements across South Africa through actions that ensure that these constitutional rights are enjoyed in practice.\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The Social Justice Coalition was founded in 2008, as a grassroots social movement with branches in various informal settlements, mainly in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. The movement has 14 active branches, 2000 members, and over 60 partner organisations. The Social Justice Coalition promotes active citizenship through education, policy and research, and community organising to ensure that government is accountable, open and responsive. The branches are the movement\u2019s main tool of mobilisation and they also play an educative role.\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>The Social Justice Coalition engages in campaigns and programmes aimed achieving a safer environment and improved access to justice and basic services through engagement between government and citizens. The 2014/2015 Social Justice Coalition annual report showed that branch members also organised branch activities such as public debates, sports tournaments, documentary screenings, and drama groups. These activities promote political education and involvement. The movement also holds annual lectures to encourage active citizenship and engagement on issues directly related to people living in poor and working class communities, but to all people living\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>The major projects in the Social Justice Coalition include the Safety and Justice programme. This Program is designed to make Khayelitsha and all of South Africa a safer place where there is improved access to justice and a better working relationship between the police and communities. The programme\u2019s activities involved campaigning to the Western Cape government for the establishment of a Khayelitsha Commission of Enquiry on policing. The Social Justice Coalition led a group of social movements based in Khayelitsha such as the \u2018Treatment Action Campaign, Equal Education and Free Gender, supported by Ndifuna Ukwazi and Triangle Project to campaign for the Western Cape government to establish the Commission.</p><p>The Social Justice Coalition also has a local government programme aimed at improving government accountability. The movement established a campaign for clean and safe sanitation. The campaign calls for clean and safe sanitation facilities in informal settlements \u2013 areas which are disproportionately affected by crime. To this end, the movement has also conducted a social audit of toilets in Khayelitsha\u2019s informal settlements. The Social Justice Coalition has been monitoring \u2018Mshengu\u2019 toilets and other service providers for a number of years and continues to identify shortcomings with regard to cleaning and general maintenance. This shows some of the projects the movement has been involved in.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.sjc.org.za/about-us\">http://www.sjc.org.za/about-us</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/Social-Justice-Coalition-Report-of-the-Khayelitsha-Mshengu-Toilet-Social-Audit.pdf\">http://www.internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/Social-Justice-Coalition-Report-of-the-Khayelitsha-Mshengu-Toilet-Social-Audit.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sjc.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SJC-Annual-Report-2014-2015.pdf\">http://www.sjc.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SJC-Annual-Report-2014-2015.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ngopulse.org/event/sjc-third-irene-grootboom-memorial-lecture-series\">http://www.ngopulse.org/event/sjc-third-irene-grootboom-memorial-lecture-series</a></p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Social Justice Coalition (SJC)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/social-justice-coalition-sjc", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "147792", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "For Profit", "updated_date": "2016-05-07T16:26:49", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Abdu Gnaba", "post_date": "2016-05-07T16:26:49", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4371", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Budgeting||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<p><em>Note: this article is a stub.

Problems and Purpose</h2><p>The world is full of challenges: low access to education, lack of government capacity, discrimination, environment emergency, inaccessible healthcare systems and unequal distribution of wealth. These and a lot of other challenges affect millions of people around the world without citizens of any age getting involved in facing them.<a href=\"//hd.ad.syr.edu/02/4dfe02/Documents/GRAF/Design%20for%20change%20-%20Participadia%20Report.docx#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Design for Change is an initiative that seeks to engage people in problem solving in their communities at the school level.</p><p>The initiative responds to the question \u201cHow can we help our children develop passion for knowledge and compassion for the world around them? How can make people believe that children are not helpless? That change is possible and they can drive it?\u201d</p><p>The direct purpose of Design for Change is to recognize that children are capable of being socially aware and proactive change agents in their community. For that purpose, there is need to promote a learning environment that focuses on passion and compassion, content and character, doing well and doing good.<a href=\"//hd.ad.syr.edu/02/4dfe02/Documents/GRAF/Design%20for%20change%20-%20Participadia%20Report.docx#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a></p><p>The initiative proposes that \u201cTo impact a positive transformation in the environment, we need to design solutions with individuals, rather than for them. Design thinking gives us tools and skills that enable us to stop assuming and start engaging, empathizing and understanding. It helps us move from the current-state to a preferred-state \u2013 for ourselves as well as for others.\u201d<a href=\"//hd.ad.syr.edu/02/4dfe02/Documents/GRAF/Design%20for%20change%20-%20Participadia%20Report.docx#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Design for Change \u201cequips children with the tools to be aware of the world around them, believe that they play a role in shaping that world, and take action toward a more desirable, sustainable future.\u201d<a href=\"//hd.ad.syr.edu/02/4dfe02/Documents/GRAF/Design%20for%20change%20-%20Participadia%20Report.docx#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a> It teaches children that they do not have to be rich or strong or powerful to make change happen.</p><h2>2. History</h2><p>While trying to empower people to manage the challenges their communities face, Kiran Bir Sethi founded \u2018The Riverside School\u2019 in Ahmedabad, India, in 2001, and \u2018Design for Change\u2019 in 2009. As the initiative explains, \u201cShe started this movement with a conviction that if young people were empowered and made to feel that they could take matters into their hands, they would change the world for the better. Kiran relied heavily on her background as an Industrial Designer to pilot the very first design-thinking guide for young people across India.\u201d<a href=\"//hd.ad.syr.edu/02/4dfe02/Documents/GRAF/Design%20for%20change%20-%20Participadia%20Report.docx#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a></p><p>Kiran Bir Sethi narrates that when 6-year-old son had the word \u201cchoice\u201d removed from his vocabulary by a teacher she started to think that she wanted to bring back it in. \u00a0In India, 200 million children go to school, only 18 million go to college from which 90% did not have necessary employment skills. She felt that they had been filled with the feeling of \u201cI can\u00b4t\u201d. So as a designer she wanted to design an approach to education that would equip children with the tools to be able to say \u201cI can\u201d instead of \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d and founded The Riverside School in Ahmedabad (India) in 2001. In the next ten years, the Riverside School students outperformed the top 10 schools in India. Because it was working for the 350 children that were part of that private school she decided to expand it in 2009.<a href=\"//hd.ad.syr.edu/02/4dfe02/Documents/GRAF/Design%20for%20change%20-%20Participadia%20Report.docx#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a> From March to June \u2013 when they launched it- everything was design on the go and put in very simple guide with four simple steps: \u201cFEEL any problem that bothers you, IMAGINE a way to make it better, DO an act of change and SHARE your story of change with the world. She believed the Feel-Imagine-Do-Share framework, would help cultivate what\u2019s called the I CAN mindset, a belief that young people are not helpless, that change is possible and they can drive it.\u201d<a href=\"//hd.ad.syr.edu/02/4dfe02/Documents/GRAF/Design%20for%20change%20-%20Participadia%20Report.docx#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\" id=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a></p><p>First year, on 2009, they send the guide to 30,000 schools on India, then she had the opportunity to give a TED Talk on the matter and in 2010 it went viral. In 2010 it changed from being an idea on India to be worldwide: Korea, Australia, Brazil, Russia, Taiwan. In 2011 the initiative won the Design to Improve Life Award, and started to get support from Education Experts such as Howard Gardner who said \u201cIt is a simple idea, but is a constructive idea at the same time. We can\u2019t deal with ideas [that are] too complicated, they don\u2019t travel, and so many ideas are self-congratulatory rather than constructive. What I see is that this is wonderful constructive gift to the school, the community, the nation and now many other countries around the world.\u201d. In 2012 they won the Rockefeller Foundation Innovation Award and expanded to have collected 800 stories in India and 4,200 worldwide.</p><h2>3. \u00a0Entities and Funding</h2><p>. The following timeline gives us a clear idea of the source of funding by year, that is mostly grants or award from Humanitarian Foundations. They have gotten awards from: Index Awards on 2011, Fetzer Institute<strong><u>, </u></strong>Rockefeller Foundation<strong><u>, </u></strong>The LEGO Foundation<strong><u>, </u></strong>Ashoja \u201cEveryone is a change maker\u201d<strong><u>, </u></strong>The Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Commonwealth. Additionally, their partners and collaborators are: \u201cAnybody can jump\u201d a CARE Foundation Initiative, National Institute of Design, Institute of Design at Stanford, IDEO, The Good Project \u201cIdeas and tools for a good life\u201d, World\u2019s largest lessons, DAAN UTSAV, and Claris.</p><p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p><h2>Method: \u201cDesign Thinking\u201d</h2><p>The Design for Change method is a process of collaborative and creative thinking that enables students to find innovative solutions to problems and challenges that they face every day, either at school or within their community. The solutions can go from designing a machine to improving a social service. This process has the empathy as a central concept. When the students start to connect with the problem they want to address, then they begin to understand the situation, and its multiple faces. The analytical piece of this method comes when the students and teachers engage within the four main steps of the program (Find, Imagine, Do, Share). The final goal is to come up with the best package of solutions by integrating the whole community if it is necessary. Students then begin to analyze different perspectives of the same problem by gathering data and testing solutions. Design for Change seeks to promote an analytical thinking among students, teachers, communities, and parents. The idea is for them to get a well-founded knowledge of the subject, and stay away from easy and fast solutions. Fostering children\u2019s creativity is the most important goal for DFC.</p><p>Here is when the collaborative work starts to strengthen. The teams begin to design solutions (action plans), and prepare the strategy to implement them.</p><p>Design for Change offers this method for free and in a friendly way to the public (website). The method has proved to be easy to follow. More than 30 countries have adopted the program and the outcomes are positives. The problem is quickly addressed, teachers and students enhance their relationship and the community gets benefit. One of the most recent and innovative components of the method is the last stage entitled as \u00b4Share\u00b4. \u201cThis stage helps the children to reflect about what has been achieved, and also to inspire their peers to be the change, and do not wait for others to address them,\u201d concluded Allende.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h2>4. Participant Selection</h2><p>Participants in the Design for Change method are self-selecting. The curriculum is open to children in kindergarten to eighth grade who are accompanied by an adult Design for Change member. \u00a0The school challenge is completely open because Design for Change believes that every child and teenager has the capacity to become a valued and active citizen. The adult mentor can play a variety of roles such as teachers, parents, youth leaders, and coaches. Countries that participate in Design for Change host a national social change school competition every year and give a deadline near the end of the school year in May. Team projects are evaluated and one team is selected to represent their country at the Global Conference. This two-day event is an opportunity to collaborate and inspire across borders.</p><h2>5. Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h2><p>The Design for Change social change methodology is broken into four steps: feel, imagine, do, and share. The following table outlines all steps children will take to fully implement their projects as well as the skills associated with activities. The critical approach that makes this method so innovative is that the social change must come from the children, so though the mentors have a large responsibility in guiding them, they play more of a background role.</p><p>Mentor registration is easy and quick; all that is required is a free online account, organization name, and project idea. Mentors are also trained for three hours in either online or live sessions. When beginning a project, mentors are prompted to create a project plan by selecting pre-made activities from their activity catalog that correspond with the four-step model. Different activities aim to achieve different skill objectives as they move through the process. The activity can be downloaded as a pdf lesson plan that contains recommendations for age and time needed, connections to educational standards linked to common core, objectives, a list of materials needed, and deliverables. The following outlines the path taken in the student-focused design handbook for each of the FEEl, IMAGINE, DO, and SHARE themes as well as the skills embedded in lessons provided by the Design For Change website dashboard.</p><p>Feel</p><p>1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be a Cartographer</p><p>1.1. \u00a0\u00a0Map Your World</p><p>1.2. \u00a0\u00a0Case Studies</p><p>1.3. \u00a0\u00a0Opportunities for Change</p><p>2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be a Detective</p><p>2.1. \u00a0\u00a0Identify</p><p>2.2. \u00a0\u00a0Observations</p><p>3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be a Reporter</p><p>3.1. \u00a0\u00a0Interview</p><p>4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Findings</p><p>5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wrapping Up</p><p>Imagine</p><p>1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Best Case Scenario</p><p>1.1. \u00a0\u00a0Brainstorming Rules</p><p>1.2. \u00a0\u00a0Case Study</p><p>2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brainstorm</p><p>3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vote to Select Best Idea</p><p>4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imagine Impact</p><p>5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wrapping Up</p><p>Do</p><p>1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prototyping</p><p>2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plan for Success</p><p>2.1. \u00a0\u00a0Launch Your Project</p><p>3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Capturing Stories</p><p>4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wrapping Up</p><p>Share</p><p>1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be a Storyteller</p><p>2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Share Your Story, In a School, in Your Community, In the Media</p><p>3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submit Your Story to Share It with the World</p><p>Skill Objectives: Awareness, Engagement, Empathy, Collaboration/teamwork, Communication, Connection, Creativity, Critical Thinking, Initiative, Reflection, Resilience, Responsibility, Brainstorming, Contextualizing, Leadership, Organization, Strategizing</p>\u00a0<p>According to the U.S.A Design for Change Website, the framework they use offers a 30-hour design thinking curriculum that was created in collaboration with entities such as experts at Harvard, Stanford, and IDEO. The theory behind the four step process is what drives the deliberation, decisions, and public interaction through this method.</p><p>The <strong>Feel </strong>stage is the crucial first step in \u201cbuilding character, capacity, and confidence as a problem solver.\u201d The web portal guide nods to design thinking as a community-centers problem solving technique. This step emphasizes the importance of Change Makers ability to understand core issues, empathize, and continuously engage with their communities. Additional resources are provided on empathy in design thinking, empathy in the classroom, the power of motivation, and design thinking boot camp.</p><p>\u201cThe <strong>Imagine</strong> stage is essential to turning your learnings from empathetic exploration into possible solutions.\u201d This stage focuses on building an atmosphere where Change Makers can feel free and motivated to brainstorm with unbridled creativity. It is during this step that the team will assess its skills and interests and the feasibility of their most innovative ideas. The web portal provides additional information on creativity or \u201cIdeation\u201d in design thinking and the power of convergent and divergent thinking.</p><p>The <strong>Do</strong> stage gives full implementation power to the students and promotes responsibility, accountability, and confidence. This is the step where they will begin turning ideas into action and persevere to see their goals achieved. Important lessons can be learned from this step, such as how to be resilient and how to recover and learn from failure.</p><p>Finally, the <strong>Share</strong> stage has teams reflect on the impact of their project and the learning process through the methodology. Teams abide by submission guidelines to ensure their stories are succinct and shareable. These videos are reviewed and compiled on the Design for Change YouTube Channel. Many times, they are used to supplement guidance on the web portals as well. Design for Change lauds this step as one of the most important because it inspires others, spreads the movement, and most importantly, validates all the hard work the children have put into the process.</p><p>The application of these four steps is designed to train children to think about problem solving in an empathetic way that gets them out into the community. Deliberation, decisions, and public interaction are required and are a natural progression through this method. An example of this in action can be seen through the project DCF2012 Singapore: Elderly Cleaners. Students deliberated by brainstorming problems to tackle based on what they have observed in their communities. This team felt that elderly cleaners in their school were not respected for the hard work they do. Public participation happened early in the process when they designed a public poll (complete with a bookmark as an incentive!) and interviewed strangers in their community. They used their feedback to develop and poster campaign to raise awareness about the issue which also involved fundraising, a peer-quiz, public speaking, and mind-maps. Their project was successful and they could see attitudes changing for the better in their school.</p><h2>6. Influence, outcomes and effects</h2><p>Design for Change defines its method of education as a \u201cschool challenge,\u201d and it is open to the students and their communities. Once the teachers get to know this new method of participation, and receive guidance from Design for Change Worldwide (it has offices in more than 30 countries), they decide which group is going to work with them. However, it often happens that the method is first known by the students rather than teachers. If this is the case, the children form a group, and then look for a teacher who is willing to accompany them during the whole process of change. On the other hand, Design for Change commits to accompany the mentor (teacher) during the whole process, depending on their needs. In this sense, DFC is a two-way communication between the participants involved. They engage and build a small scale decision-making process to maximize the impact of their efforts beyond the class.</p><p>One of the thing it develops is empathy. In that sense, the relationship between students and their mentor improves and matures enormously along the process of change. The children feel heard and important; they feel the responsibility of working in groups in order to achieve a greater good. The same applies to the extended community that gets involved. Some parents often do not believe in the abilities of their children, but once they see what they have achieved, they change their minds. This method enables students to be more empowered and take decisions that affects them or their communities lives. In other words, the result drives a complete change of mindset from the most skeptical stakeholders. Adults ended up believing in the potential of the youth and give the children the space they need to impact their environment. Also it happens that children see what other groups are achieving through this method, and then they want to imitate the project, as well. So, the first group ends up leading an initiative that involves many actors within the school community, and even beyond (government, NGOs, IO and donors). Therefore, the implementation of the program is far from being a hierarchical decision-making process; everyone gets involved and the benefits from this interaction are enormous to both students (See Annex 1), and teachers (Annex 2).</p><h2>7. Analysis and Lessons</h2><p>\u201cDesign for Change\u201d is thought to be a school challenge. However, it is not a contest. The idea is that all the changes made within schools and communities are shared and imitated all over the world by posting the case on the website, organizing events beyond the school, and adding supporters, such as local governments and private companies. \u201cOur aim as an organization is to challenge the children to become the catalysts of change they want to see in the world\u201d, said Natalia Allende, representative of DFC Chile. \u201cIn this context we do not choose the winners, but we have a jury that evaluates each case based on its impact, creativity, and boldness,\u201d she added.</p><p>However, Design for Change hosts annually an international meeting called \u201cI Can,\u201d where children and youth across any country share their experiences, celebrate the change and learn more from each other\u2019s stories.

Com suas ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es, acampamentos, marchas e assentamentos rurais, o MST colocou o tema da reforma agr\u00e1ria de volta na pauta pol\u00edtica brasileira, reinventou formas de protesto, estabeleceu novos termos da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre trabalhadores rurais e o Estado. Mais recentemente, o movimento enfatiza a luta contra o agroneg\u00f3cio e o modelo agroexportador que domina a pol\u00edtica brasileira para o setor, discutindo soberania alimentar e demandando estrutura de suporte \u00e0 economia camponesa.A relev\u00e2ncia do MST reside n\u00e3o apenas em suas atividades, mas em sua \u00a0influ\u00eancia sobre outros movimentos sociais brasileiros \u2013 no campo e na cidade \u2013 e sobre movimentos rurais todo o mundo, em especial ap\u00f3s seu proeminente papel na cria\u00e7\u00e3o e na consolida\u00e7\u00e3o da Via Campesina, um movimento transnacional campon\u00eas.[1]\u00a0 O MST est\u00e1 presente, atualmente, em 24 estados brasileiros, em todas as regi\u00f5es do pa\u00eds. Segundo c\u00e1lculos do pr\u00f3prio movimento, 350 mil fam\u00edlias conquistaram terra por meio da luta e da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos trabalhadores rurais.[2] Calcula-se que o MST tenha \u00a0cerca de 1,14 milh\u00e3o de membros, esteja a frente de 2 mil assentamentos, 161 cooperativas e 140 agroind\u00fastrias. Com todas as cr\u00edticas aos processos de reforma agr\u00e1ria no Brasil \u2013 parciais e, por vezes, prec\u00e1rios \u2013, o MST foi sujeito central na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de mais de 3,7 milh\u00f5es de hectares de terra (os dados s\u00e3o de 2009).[3]Como se organiza - A organiza\u00e7\u00e3o do MST tem como base n\u00facleos de fam\u00edlias que vivem nos assentamentos e acampamentos. Cada n\u00facleo \u00e9 composto por cerca de uma dezena de fam\u00edlias, que escolhem sua coordena\u00e7\u00e3o. Como fruto dos debates de g\u00eanero, \u00e9 estabelecido que haja sempre uma dupla de coordenadores: um homem e uma mulher.[4] \u00a0Acampamentos e assentamentos realizam assembleias periodicamente, que indicam coordenadores para as inst\u00e2ncias estaduais. A coordena\u00e7\u00e3o das atividades estaduais fica a cargo das secretarias estaduais e a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de prioridades dos Encontros Estaduais.H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m uma secretaria, uma coordena\u00e7\u00e3o e uma dire\u00e7\u00e3o nacionais. Nesta esfera, as inst\u00e2ncias de decis\u00e3o incluem o Congresso Nacional (que acontece, em geral, a cada cinco anos) e o Encontro Nacional (a cada dois anos).[5] \u00a0Al\u00e9m disso, atualmente o movimento organiza-se em onze setores: forma\u00e7\u00e3o, educa\u00e7\u00e3o, produ\u00e7\u00e3o, g\u00eanero, sa\u00fade, comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, projetos, frente de massa, direitos humanos, finan\u00e7as e rela\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais. H\u00e1 ainda coletivos sobre temas transversais, como o de m\u00edstica.\u00a0\u00a0<h3>History</h3>Quando a ditadura civil-militar brasileira (1964-1985) j\u00e1 mostrava sinais de enfraquecimento, popula\u00e7\u00f5es do campo e da cidade voltaram a organizar-se publicamente. Parte desse cen\u00e1rio, o MST nasceu na primeira metade da d\u00e9cada de 1980, organizando popula\u00e7\u00f5es rurais para lutar pelo acesso \u00e0 terra por meio da reforma agr\u00e1ria. Organizou-se inicialmente nos estados do Sul e do Sudeste do pa\u00eds.[6]\u00a0Estudiosos do MST trabalham com quatro momentos de territorializa\u00e7\u00e3o do grupo: 1) Gesta\u00e7\u00e3o (1979-84): come\u00e7a com ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es de terras no Sul do Brasil e estende-se at\u00e9 sua funda\u00e7\u00e3o, em 1984, quando as ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es passam a ocorrer tamb\u00e9m no Sudeste e Centro-Oeste; 2) Consolida\u00e7\u00e3o (1985-89): quando o movimento ganha escala nacional e o Brasil volta a trilhar o caminho da democratiza\u00e7\u00e3o; 3) Institucionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: a partir de 1990, per\u00edodo em o MST torna-se \u201co principal interlocutor do governo federal a respeito da reforma agr\u00e1ria e \u00e9 reconhecido internacionalmente\u201d.[7] S\u00e3o criadas novas pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas para as popula\u00e7\u00f5es rurais, a exemplo de um programa de cr\u00e9dito para agricultores familiares. O MST cria cooperativas, escolas, centros de forma\u00e7\u00e3o e pesquisa e organiza seus coletivos; por fim, a fase 4) Mundializa\u00e7\u00e3o: fase relativa \u00e0 cria\u00e7\u00e3o e ao fortalecimento da Via Campesina.[8]H\u00e1, por\u00e9m, pesquisadores que questionam tal periodiza\u00e7\u00e3o, defendendo que as fases n\u00e3o s\u00e3o estanques, mas sobrep\u00f5em-se. Afirmam, por exemplo, que os la\u00e7os internacionais do movimento s\u00e3o inclusive anteriores \u00e0 sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o oficial, em 1984.[9]O MST obteve proje\u00e7\u00e3o nacional desde as ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es que lhe deram origem. Em 1981, o apoio ao acampamento na Encruzilhada Natalino, no Rio Grande do Sul, reuniu mais de 600 fam\u00edlias, agregou apoios vindos de todo o pa\u00eds e virou s\u00edmbolo da luta pela terra no per\u00edodo de redemocratiza\u00e7\u00e3o.[10] Pouco depois, houve grandes ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es em 1990, no Pontal do Paranapanema, em S\u00e3o Paulo, que marcou a\u00e7\u00f5es do grupo no estado mais populoso do pa\u00eds, e em Pernambuco, 1992, quando usinas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de cana, em crise, foram retomadas por trabalhadores, reinventando a ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o de terra como repert\u00f3rio de a\u00e7\u00e3o na regi\u00e3o.[11]Outros momentos cruciais para a proje\u00e7\u00e3o nacional e internacional do movimento foram suas marchas nacionais em 2005, 1999 e em 1997- esta \u00faltima reuniu 100 mil pessoas em Bras\u00edlia. Os massacres de trabalhadores rurais em Corumbiara, Rond\u00f4nia (1995), Eldorado dos Caraj\u00e1s, Par\u00e1 (1996) e Felisburgo, Minas Gerais (2004) colocaram o movimento na imprensa nacional e internacional. Nesses momentos, o MST conseguiu catalisar o sentimento de indigna\u00e7\u00e3o de muita gente.\u00a0<h3>Specializations and activities</h3>Pelo menos at\u00e9 a \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, a forma de a\u00e7\u00e3o que caracterizou as atividades do MST foi a ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o de terras. Ap\u00f3s a entrada dos grupos organizados nas \u00e1reas que o movimento gostaria de ver desapropriadas, instala-se um acampamento e seguem-se intensas disputas, em geral com despejos e reintegra\u00e7\u00f5es de posse. Por vezes, os acampamentos mudam-se para a beira das estradas. Com a repeti\u00e7\u00e3o dessas a\u00e7\u00f5es, sobretudo nas d\u00e9cadas de 1980 e 1990, as barracas de lona preta e a bandeira hasteada passaram a ser entendidos pela sociedade com o sinal de que ali havia uma demanda por terras. Mais do que isso, a \u201cforma acampamento\u201d tornou-se a \u201cforma apropriada\u201d de demandar terras no Brasil [12] , pois o Estado brasileiro acabou por aceita-la, adaptar sua burocracia a este formato e a organizar sua a\u00e7\u00e3o de reforma agr\u00e1ria a reboque das demandas dos movimentos sociais. Foi, ent\u00e3o, mimetizada por outros movimentos sociais, do campo e, mais tarde, tamb\u00e9m da cidadeQuando h\u00e1 acordo sobre a possibilidade de desapropriar \u00e1reas \u2013 e recursos financeiros \u2013 o Estado responde \u00e0s press\u00f5es do movimento, legitimando-as. Por\u00e9m, nem sempre desapropria as \u00e1reas em quest\u00e3o e por vezes instala os assentamentos em locais distantes do solicitado, dos mercados consumidores e de infra-estrutura \u2013 por exemplo, na regi\u00e3o Norte do pa\u00eds, onde ainda h\u00e1 maiores extens\u00f5es de terras p\u00fablicas dispon\u00edveis.As rela\u00e7\u00f5es do MST com o Estado brasileiro s\u00e3o tema importante, foco de muita reflex\u00e3o e pol\u00eamica: onde alguns autores v\u00eaem sobretudo conflitos [13], outros v\u00eaem tamb\u00e9m coopera\u00e7\u00e3o e interdepend\u00eancia [14] ou at\u00e9 a emerg\u00eancia de uma improv\u00e1vel democracia participativa [15]. O MST, de forma geral, afirma enxergar o Estado como um espa\u00e7o dominado pelas elites econ\u00f4micas, voltado a atender seus interesses \u2013 que, no campo, foram sintetizados nas figuras dos latifundi\u00e1rios, at\u00e9 o in\u00edcio do s\u00e9culo 21 e no agroneg\u00f3cio, a partir de ent\u00e3o. O que o movimento pode fazer, face a isso, \u00e9 disputar a hegemonia do Estado (e, a longo prazo, lutar por processos de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o mais profundos) [16]. Tendo em vista o menor acesso aos recursos pelas popula\u00e7\u00f5es pobres, a a\u00e7\u00e3o poss\u00edvel \u00e9 a de confronto p\u00fablico, de massa.\u00a0Esse entendimento tem impactos importantes na forma como o MST pensa a participa\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica institucional. O movimento resiste a empregar o tempo de seus militantes em atividades relativas a institui\u00e7\u00f5es participativas [17], pois identifica pouco potencial de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o. Ainda durante o governo Fernando Henrique Cardoso, quando foi criado um programa nacional de cr\u00e9dito para agricultores familiares \u2013 o Pronaf \u2013, que levou \u00e0 instala\u00e7\u00e3o de conselhos municipais de desenvolvimento territorial, o MST n\u00e3o ocupou tais espa\u00e7os institucionalmente, preocupado em manter autonomia e evitar coopta\u00e7\u00e3o. Apesar disso, associa\u00e7\u00f5es locais vinculadas ao movimento participaram em determinados per\u00edodos, em alguns munic\u00edpios, e foram respons\u00e1veis por importantes debates em torno da democratiza\u00e7\u00e3o das pr\u00e1ticas desses conselhos[18]Esta postura tem se mantido nos anos de governo do Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), desde 2003, quando multiplicaram-se os espa\u00e7os institucionais de participa\u00e7\u00e3o. A op\u00e7\u00e3o pela participa\u00e7\u00e3o institucional ocorre apenas pontualmente, protagonizada por alguns setores do movimento. O Setor de Sa\u00fade do MST, por exemplo, tem caminhado nessa dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 atualmente (em 2015) suplente no Conselho Nacional de Sa\u00fade e tem representa\u00e7\u00e3o no Grupo da Terra, que discute a pol\u00edtica para popula\u00e7\u00f5es do campo. At\u00e9 hoje, o MST n\u00e3o participa do Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Rural Sustent\u00e1vel e Solid\u00e1rio (Condraf). Durante os governos do PT, devido \u00e0 maior identifica\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica com o partido no poder, o MST tem mais acesso aos gestores, tendo inclusive participado de indica\u00e7\u00f5es para cargos do segundo escal\u00e3o.[19] H\u00e1 autores que apontam uma mudan\u00e7a nas estrat\u00e9gias de luta do movimento (bem como nas de outros movimentos sociais brasileiros), que teria diminu\u00eddo a \u00eanfase nas a\u00e7\u00f5es de protesto [20] e estaria, assim, modificando seus repert\u00f3rios de a\u00e7\u00e3o neste novo per\u00edodo.Recentemente, em 2014, Jo\u00e3o Pedro Stedile, um dos coordenadores nacionais do MST, assinou carta ao lado de pesquisadores e juristas defendendo a Pol\u00edtica Nacional de Participa\u00e7\u00e3o Social, proposta pela presidenta Dilma Rousseff. O Decreto 8.243/2014, que estabelecia mecanismos de participa\u00e7\u00e3o social na administra\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica, foi questionado por setores da sociedade brasileira, com ampla repercuss\u00e3o na m\u00eddia.<h3>Major projects and events</h3>Para o MST, \u201ca conquista da terra \u00e9 apenas o primeiro passo para a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o da Reforma Agr\u00e1ria\u201d, posto que ela traz consigo demandas pela instala\u00e7\u00e3o, nos assentamentos, de servi\u00e7os p\u00fablicos que n\u00e3o costumavam ser estendidos a popula\u00e7\u00f5es rurais \u2013 tais como energia, \u00e1gua pot\u00e1vel, educa\u00e7\u00e3o, sa\u00fade, cultura e lazer.\u00a0Para al\u00e9m das pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas, o MST vem desenvolvendo pr\u00e1ticas pr\u00f3prias em diversas \u00e1reas. Na sa\u00fade, desenvolve atividades de resgate e valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de conhecimentos tradicionais e mant\u00e9m programas de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o para forma\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9dicos populares com Cuba.

Atualmente, as 164 organiza\u00e7\u00f5es que fazem parte da Via Campesina projetam-se nos debates mundiais sobre produ\u00e7\u00e3o de alimentos e alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es com discurso cr\u00edtico \u00e0s empresas multinacionais e ao agroneg\u00f3cio. Defendem reformas agr\u00e1rias em diversos pa\u00edses, prop\u00f5em que camponeses e pequenos agricultores priorizem a agricultura agroecol\u00f3gica, rejeitando o uso de agrot\u00f3xicos e de sementes transg\u00eanicas. Para a Via Campesina, seus agricultores s\u00e3o guardi\u00f5es da diversidade de sementes do planeta.Em 1996, a Via Campesina cunhou o termo soberania alimentar, em contraposi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 ideia de seguran\u00e7a alimentar que vem sendo debatida por governos e organiza\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais, sobretudo nos f\u00f3runs da FAO. Desde ent\u00e3o, o conceito espalhou-se consideravelmente por movimentos sociais e foi inclu\u00eddo em constitui\u00e7\u00f5es de pa\u00edses como Nepal[2] e Bol\u00edvia[3].Atualmente (2015), essa organiza\u00e7\u00e3o transnacional organiza-se em nove regi\u00f5es: \u00c1frica 1 (pa\u00edses ao Sul do continente), \u00c1frica 2 (Noroeste africano), Am\u00e9rica do Norte, Am\u00e9rica do Sul, Am\u00e9rica Central, Caribe, Europa, Sul da \u00c1sia, Sudoeste e leste da \u00c1sia.[4] Cada regi\u00e3o realiza, periodicamente, assembleias que escolhem delegados. Eles formam um comit\u00ea de coordena\u00e7\u00e3o internacional (International Coordinating Commission). Delegados de todas as regi\u00f5es encontram-se a cada quatro anos para definir pol\u00edticas e estrat\u00e9gias, nas Assembleias do grupo. Nesses momentos, em paralelo, h\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m assembleias de mulheres (desde 2000) e de jovens (desde 2004).Manter reunidos grupos de origens, perfis socioecon\u00f4micos e orienta\u00e7\u00f5es pol\u00edticas distintas \u00e9 um dos grandes desafios a Via Campesina. Os encontros de seus militantes \u2013 em \u00e2mbito nacional, regional e global, nas reuni\u00f5es em atividades de protesto e nas reuni\u00f5es internacionais das quais participam \u2013 s\u00e3o momentos cr\u00edticos para avan\u00e7ar no entendimento das distintas realidades e de constru\u00e7\u00e3o de unidade, o que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio para que se chegue a acordos sobre prioridades e estrat\u00e9gias de a\u00e7\u00e3o comuns.[5] Ao agregar atores e atrizes t\u00e3o diversos, a Via Campesina vem reformulando o conceito de campesinato e contribuindo para sua proje\u00e7\u00e3o internacional como categoria de a\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica.\u00a0<h3>History</h3>Movimentos rurais constroem coaliz\u00f5es internacionais desde o final do s\u00e9culo 19, orientados por internacionalismos comunistas, pelo pacifismo ou pelo feminismo. Nas Am\u00e9ricas e na Europa, desde a d\u00e9cada de 1960 houve liga\u00e7\u00f5es fortes por meio de redes de solidariedade e resist\u00eancia \u00e0s ditaduras do per\u00edodo, com realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de interc\u00e2mbios entre militantes rurais. A\u00e7\u00f5es transnacionais intensificaram-se a partir de meados dos anos 1980, quando institui\u00e7\u00f5es supranacionais ganharam for\u00e7a e a agricultura foi inclu\u00edda nos debates sobre acordos de livre-com\u00e9rcio. No in\u00edcio da d\u00e9cada de 1990, um dos grandes temas foi o Acordo Geral de Tarifas e Com\u00e9rcio (o GATT, que define tarifas, subs\u00eddios e regras para exporta\u00e7\u00f5es). Na Am\u00e9rica do Sul, campanhas - como a que marcou os 500 anos de resist\u00eancia ind\u00edgena, negra e camponesa -tamb\u00e9m foram motivos de atividades conjuntas.[6]\u00a0A Via Campesina nasceu em 1993, questionando as redefini\u00e7\u00f5es das pol\u00edticas agr\u00edcolas e das legisla\u00e7\u00f5es nacionais que estavam em curso, promovidas por governos nacionais e por institui\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais.[7] Tr\u00eas anos ap\u00f3s sua funda\u00e7\u00e3o, a Via Campesina j\u00e1 era ator pol\u00edtico relevante na C\u00fapula Mundial Sobre Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o (CMA) promovida pela Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas para Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e Agricultura (FAO) em 1996. Pouco depois, os ativistas de bon\u00e9s, camisetas e bandeiras verdes da Via Campesina deram volume \u00e0s marchas contra a globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o neoliberal, realizadas em paralelo \u00e0s reuni\u00f5es de governos nas cidades de Genebra (1998), Seattle (1999), Cancun (2003) e Hong Kong (2005), entre outras. Desde o in\u00edcio dos anos 2000, a Via Campesina e suas organiza\u00e7\u00f5es-membro fizeram parte dos F\u00f3runs Sociais Mundiais (FSM).[8] Um de seus principais lemas, \u201cglobalizemos a luta, globalizemos a esperan\u00e7a\u201d, dialoga diretamente com os princ\u00edpios altermundistas agregados no FSM. Entre suas vit\u00f3rias, figuram a volta do debate sobre reforma agr\u00e1ria em f\u00f3runs como a confer\u00eancia da FAO em 1995 e \u00e0 agenda global (p.207), os estragos nas rodadas do Uruguai e do Mil\u00eanio sobre com\u00e9rcio, restri\u00e7\u00f5es ao com\u00e9rcio de sementes geneticamente modificadas em alguns pa\u00edses.[9]J\u00e1 no s\u00e9culo 21, o discurso e as a\u00e7\u00f5es da Via Campesina voltaram-se \u00e0 cr\u00edtica das crises mundiais \u2013 de alimentos, energ\u00e9tica, \u00e9tica, social, econ\u00f4mica e financeira, clim\u00e1tica \u2013 situando-as como produto do sistema capitalismo e do neoliberalismo. Ganharam for\u00e7a tamb\u00e9m debates sobre o clima. Para ambos, a soberania alimentar continua sendo apontada como parte das solu\u00e7\u00f5es poss\u00edveis e necess\u00e1rias para as diversas crises.A Via Campesina reivindica e atualiza a tradi\u00e7\u00e3o internacionalista de esquerda, contrapondo-se \u00e0 expans\u00e3o da economia capitalista para a agricultura. Para algumas pesquisadoras, a Via constr\u00f3i um \u201cprojeto alternativo de sociedade que questiona o modelo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o, em especial, no meio rural\u201d.[10]\u00a0<h3>Specializations and activities</h3>Entre as a\u00e7\u00f5es da Via Campesina, figuram protestos, marchas, a\u00e7\u00f5es diretas, mas \u00a0tamb\u00e9m a participa\u00e7\u00e3o e incid\u00eancia em f\u00f3runs e institui\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais, atividades de promo\u00e7\u00e3o da solidariedade e coopera\u00e7\u00e3o internacional. Por vezes, tais estrat\u00e9gias s\u00e3o usadas em conjunto; outras vezes, s\u00e3o empregadas separadamente.As atividades de solidariedade e coopera\u00e7\u00e3o incluem projetos internacionais e interc\u00e2mbios entre camponeses sobre formas de trabalho agr\u00edcola e organiza\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica. Ela tamb\u00e9m criou uma rede de solidariedade capaz de dar respostas a atos violentos por meio da proje\u00e7\u00e3o internacional de debates e problemas, e de conferir visibilidade a lutas locais que se desenvolvem ao redor do mundo, conectando-as em um movimento global.A altern\u00e2ncia entre a\u00e7\u00f5es de protesto e a participa\u00e7\u00e3o nos debates \u2013 em reuni\u00f5es, conselhos, confer\u00eancias \u2013 j\u00e1 foi tema de algumas pesquisas sobre a Via Campesina. Participa\u00e7\u00e3o, para o grupo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 um termo relacionado apenas a di\u00e1logo o e mudan\u00e7as nas formas de agir das organiza\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais, mas tamb\u00e9m a tentativas de coopta\u00e7\u00e3o do movimento, de fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de consensos e \u00e0 legitima\u00e7\u00e3o dos atores.De modo geral, quando a Via n\u00e3o identifica chances reais de incidir nos debates, ela prefere manifestar-se do lado de fora a sentar em mensas de negocia\u00e7\u00e3o que podem, inclusive, referendar atores cuja legitimidade ela questiona. \u00c9 o que ocorre com os debates da Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Mundial do Com\u00e9rcio. Por n\u00e3o reconhecer a legitimidade da OMC para tratar do tema, ela opta por manter-se fora das negocia\u00e7\u00f5es[11] Mais que isso, a Via Campesina defende que o tema da agricultura seja retirado dos debates dessa organiza\u00e7\u00e3o, e tece criticas \u00e0 falta de transpar\u00eancia e presta\u00e7\u00e3o de contas, considerando suas pr\u00e1ticas, inclusive, antidemocr\u00e1ticas.[12] De forma geral, institui\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras internacionais s\u00e3o \u201cconsideradas [pela Via Campesina] elementos chave do neoliberalismo e da destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da agricultura camponesa\u201d.[13]\u00a0Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a outros organismos internacionais vinculados ao Sistema ONU, entretanto, a postura pode ser diferente, desde que o grupo considere poss\u00edvel avan\u00e7ar nas negocia\u00e7\u00f5es internamente \u2013 mesmo nesses casos, o grupo n\u00e3o prescinde de cr\u00edticas e at\u00e9 de a\u00e7\u00f5es de mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, dando for\u00e7a a cr\u00edticas como aquela que, face \u00e0 C\u00fapula Mundial sobre Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, em 1996, dizia que n\u00e3o seria poss\u00edvel solucionar a fome no mundo sem a participa\u00e7\u00e3o dos que cultivam a terra.[14] \u00a0Quase 10 anos depois, em 2004, a Via denunciava informa da FAO que apoiaa transg\u00eanicos \u00a0e sementes est\u00e9reis como alternativa para \u201cas necessidades dos pobres\u201d. Nesse momento, a FAO e a UNCTAD chegaram a ser chamadas de \u201cguardi\u00e3s do capitalismo\u201d [15]No Conselho de Direitos Humanos da ONU, a Via Campesina vem discutindo a proposta de uma \u201cDeclara\u00e7\u00e3o dos Direitos dos Camponeses e outras pessoas que trabalham no meio rural\u201d e de uma \u201cConven\u00e7\u00e3o Internacional dos Direitos Camponeses\u201d, que poder\u00e1 tratar de temas como direito \u00e0 terra, \u00e0 identidade e \u00e0 cultura e, diferente de outros instrumentos internacionais j\u00e1 conquistados, ter car\u00e1ter vinculante para os Estados que a firmarem.[16]\u00a0<h3>Major projects and events</h3>O conceito de soberania alimentar \u00e9 parte do discurso da Via Campesina desde a sua segunda assembleia, realizada em Tlaxcala, M\u00e9xico (1996). Com o passar dos anos, o conceito conquistou espa\u00e7o entre os movimentos ligados \u00e0 Via e para al\u00e9m deles. Na declara\u00e7\u00e3o da Assembleia de Jakarta, Indon\u00e9sia, de 2013, Soberania Alimentar foi definida como<em>\u201cel eje central de la lucha por un proyecto de justicia social que hoy convoca a amplios sectores del campo y la ciudad. La soberan\u00eda alimentaria es el derecho fundamental de todos los pueblos, naciones y estados a controlar sus alimentos y sus sistemas alimentarios y a decidir sus pol\u00edticas asegurando a cada uno alimentos de calidad, adecuados, accesibles, nutritivos y culturalmente apropiados. Ello incluye el derecho de los pueblos para definir sus formas de producci\u00f3n, uso e intercambio tanto a nivel local como internacional\u201d.</em>\u00a0Alguns dos principais temas discutidos pela Via Campesina \u2013 e sintetizados nas cartas de suas seis assembleias, entre 1993 e 2013, s\u00e3o:- A defesa da import\u00e2ncia da agricultura camponesa para a elimina\u00e7\u00e3o da pobreza, fome, desemprego e marginaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, cujo desenvolvimento pode inclusive ajudar a \u201cresfriar o planeta\u201d, contribuindo para o enfrentamento da crise clim\u00e1tica (SP). Os camponeses alimentam a humanidade e cuidam da natureza.- Cr\u00edtica ao capitalismo, ao neoliberalismo, \u00e0 entrada agressiva do capital especulativo e financeiro na agricultura, configurando uma agricultura industrial que tira os camponeses da terra. Para o grupo, o capital especulativo n\u00e3o deveria poder incidir sobre a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de alimentos. A Via Campesina recha\u00e7a a Economia Verde e as empresas transnacionais que, em seu entendimento, atuam em cumplicidade com governos nacionais e institui\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais.- Defesa das sementes e preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o com a apropria\u00e7\u00e3o de seus recursos gen\u00e9ticos por empresas multinacionais.- As mulheres da Via Campesina est\u00e3o organizadas desde os primeiros anos do grupo e realizaram sua primeira assembleia em Bangalore, no ano de 2000. Na assembleia de 2008, propuseram a paridade de g\u00eanero como meta para o movimento. A 3a Assembleia das mulheres, em 2013, ressaltou a necessidade de supera\u00e7\u00e3o da viol\u00eancia contra as mulheres, em suas diversas formas: f\u00edsica, econ\u00f4mica, social, machista, das diferencias de poder, e cultural. Elas afirmam haver \u201crela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00edntima entre o capitalismo, o patriarcado, o machismo e o neoliberalismo\u201d. As comunidades e organiza\u00e7\u00f5es rurais n\u00e3o est\u00e3o livres desses problemas, que foram levados ao movimento e precisam ser superados. A declara\u00e7\u00e3o de Jakarta (Assembleia de 2013) defende \u201cum mundo sem viol\u00eancia e discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o contra as mulheres\u201d.- Os jovens da Via Campesina realizaram sua 1a Assembleia Mundial em 2004. O movimento \u00a0vem discutindo a incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o da juventude camponesa em suas atividades e alternativas para a \u00a0perman\u00eancia na juventude no campo.Muitos eventos marcam o percurso da Via Campesina. O grupo estava reunido em sua segunda assembleia, no M\u00e9xico, quando recebeu not\u00edcias do assassinato de 19 camponeses brasileiros, conhecido como o massacre de Eldorado dos Caraj\u00e1s (Par\u00e1), em 17 de abril de 1996. A data passou, ent\u00e3o, a ser considerada \u201cDia Internacional de Lutas Camponesas\u201d. A cada 10 de setembro, o grupo realiza atividades do \u201cDia Internacional de Protesto conta a Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Mundial do Com\u00e9rcio\u201d, recordando o dia em que o coreano Lee Kyuong-Hae suicidou-se (sacrificou-se, nos termos da Via Campesina) com a frase \u201ca OMC mata os camponeses\u201d durante protesto em Canc\u00fan, no M\u00e9xico. Outros momentos importantes s\u00e3o a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o da Campanha Global pela Reforma Agraria e a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o do F\u00f3rum Mundial pela Reforma Agr\u00e1ria em Val\u00eancia, Espanha, em 2004. Em 2007, o Mali recebeu o F\u00f3rum Internacional sobre Soberania Alimentar em Ny\u00e9l\u00e9ni, com intensa participa\u00e7\u00e3o das mulheres. Os anos de 2006 a 2008 foram marcados por atividades de a\u00e7\u00e3o direta questionando empresas transnacionais. Na Fran\u00e7a, uma greve de fome contribuiu para a proibi\u00e7\u00e3o do plantio de milho transg\u00eanico da Monsanto, enquanto no Brasil, em 2000, as atividades contra a transnacioal Syngenta tiveram o fim tr\u00e1gico do assassinato de um militante do MST, Keno. Um ano depois, a empresa precisou desativar \u00e1rea de experimentos com transg\u00eanicos.[17]\u00a0<h3>Funding</h3>Os recursos para o funcionamento da Via Campesina v\u00eam das suas organiza\u00e7\u00f5es-membro, de projetos de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o internacional e de doa\u00e7\u00f5es de apoiadores de suas atividades.\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Publications</h3><strong>Boletins eletr\u00f4nicos (mensais)</strong> - <a href=\"http://viacampesina.org/es/index.php/publicaciones-mainmenu-30\">http://viacampesina.org/es/index.php/publicaciones-mainmenu-30</a>\u00a0<strong>Experi\u00eancias em agroecologia - </strong><a href=\"http://viacampesina.org/es/index.php/publicaciones-mainmenu-30\">http://viacampesina.org/es/index.php/publicaciones-mainmenu-30</a>\u00a0<strong>Breaking the silence!

Its founders Eyal Halamish and Matthew Gordon, together with friends, designed an online community engagement platform to do just this. Perhaps most importantly, OurSay envisage community engagement as a reciprocal process and the platform facilitates two way communication between communities and decision makers.</p><p><em>We want to ensure that in today's digital and social world, both decision makers and their communitiesare able to proactively engage with each other to make the relevant decisions\u00a0</em>(OurSay 2016)</p><h3>History</h3><p>OurSay is based in Melbourne, Australia. Its two key founders were motivated 'to do something about the lack of trust and authenticity in government decision making' (OurSay 2016). In an effort to address this huge challenge, a founding group designed an online platform through which communities and decision-makers can engage in a meaningful way.</p><p>The platform's debut was during the 2010 federal elections in Australia. Members of the public were able to pose questions to candidates, and other users then voted for their top questions. OurSay aims to provide prior commitments from politicians to provide responses to the top questions. \u00a0</p><p>Since its inception the organisation has attracted a large membership and involvement from some senior Australian politicians including Premier Julia Gillard in 2012. \u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>OurSay's main speciality is its online forum platform, which encompasses the following elements:</p><ul><li>the forum: the online space dedicated to discussing a particular topic or project that has been set up. OurSay work with governments and local councils to set up forums on various issues, such as <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/whats-big-idea-hepburn-shire-councils-plan\">Hepburn Shire's Council Plan</a>. Each forum usually lasts for around 3-4 weeks and has a 'forum leader' (the decision maker or organisation) who commits to answering the most popular questions.</li><li>questions: participants in a forum can post a question, as many as they like. They are encouraged to 'campaign' for their question through posting on social media and engaging with networks of friends, colleagues and so on.</li><li>voting: each forum participant is allocated 7 votes. They can use these votes as they like to vote for the questions they most want answers to.</li><li>responses: once the forum has closed, the forum leader will provide a response. This is not just posting a written response; they could respond through a media interview or webcast, or through a live 'response event' at a meeting or public event. All responses are recorded by OurSay and posted on the forum.\u00a0</li></ul><p>OurSay also provide a variety of other <a href=\"https://oursay.org/gov/product-and-services.html\">online engagement products and services</a>.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>In 2012 the then Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard agreed to answer three questions chosen by Australian citizens through OurSay. She responded to the winning questions through a <a href=\"https://oursay.org/hangout-with-the-prime-minister\">Google Hangout</a> which was broadcast by OurSay. 2,057 questions received over a hundred thousand votes with the winning questions covering same-sex marriage, military pensions and the government-funded school chaplaincy program.\u00a0</p><p>In 2013 <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/node/add/case\">OurSay partnered with Hepburn Shire Council</a> in Victoria to create a four year plan for the area with extensive community engagement. In this case, community members were able to pitch an idea for the Shire and the top ten voted ideas were discussed in person at a meeting with councillors, staff and the community.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>OurSay is a social enterprise organisation. It is indepedent and non-partisan. At the time of writing it could not be determined whether OurSay is a for-profit or non-profit business.\u00a0</p><p>The enterprise was started up with a $10,000 gift in 2009 (OurSay 2016).</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>OurSay (2016) About Us [online], available at: <a href=\"http://oursay.org/gov/about.html\">http://oursay.org/gov/about.html</a></p><p>OurSay (2016) How it works [online], available at:\u00a0<a href=\"https://oursay.org/how-it-works\u00a0\">https://oursay.org/how-it-works\u00a0</a></p><h3>External Links</h3><p>Short, M (2012) Power to the People, <em>The Age</em> [online], 3 December, available at:<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/power-to-the-people-20121202-2ap4h.html\">http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/power-to-the-people-20121202-2...</a></p><p>Wikipedia (2014) <em>OurSay</em> [online], available at:\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OurSay\u00a0\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OurSay\u00a0</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "Melbourne", "tags": "online deliberation||online discussion", "geo_province": "Victoria", "title_en": "OurSay", "methods": "Online deliberation||Online Voting", "path": "/organizations/oursay", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "134860", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"logo_oursay.png\", \"title\": \"OurSay logo\"}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2016-10-17T22:21:38", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Dr Janette Hartz-Karp", "post_date": "2016-06-28T05:54:45", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4456", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Australia", "content_country": "Australia", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p><em>Note: the following article is a stub.

At each table, ideas are submitted to the computer including individual, team and strongly held minority views. Table inputs are relayed to a theme team who synthesise the results and display them to the room on large screens. Key issues are prioritised, with each participant nominating their individual preferences. Preferential rakings in the form of a histogram are projected back into the room in \u2018real time\u2019. At the conclusion of the forum, each participant is given a Preliminary Report of the outcomes of the forum.\u00a0<br /><br />The consultants from 21st Century Dialogue have developed their own technology \u2013 software and networked computers \u2013 as well as the interactive group dynamics system to suit Australian requirements. They have carried out this format for Dialogue with the City (1,100 participants), Dialogue with the Pilbara: Newman 2020 (120 participants); Port Hedland Enquiry by Design (140 participants), Dialogue with Bunbury (300 participants) and Cockburn Vision Dialogue (200 participants). Dr Janette Hartz-Karp will continue with the role of designing, coordinating and lead facilitating. Les Buchanan, will continue in the role of controlling the event management. David Bruce, will continue with the design and analysis of the survey methodologies. The 21st Century Dialogue computer technology has been tried and tested on many occasions, and the computing consultant, Leor Karp will continue to provide the computing support.</em></p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=AboutUs&amp;action=Index&amp;static=1\">21st Century Dialogue's methodology </a>combines a range of established methods including:\u00a0</p><ul><li>\"<a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/consensus-forum\">Consensus Forums</a>\u00a0\u2013 which ensure that participation is representative of the population, there is informed deliberation and in-depth dialogue, and the initiative has the capacity to influence policy development and decision-making.</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/21st-century-town-meeting\">21st Century Town Meetings</a>\u00a0\u2013 with custom developed computer software that is unique, reliable and flexible, training of support personnel that is targeted and effective, and agendas that deliver the outcomes set at the commencement of the engagement.</li><li>Community Surveys - that are statistically rigorous, creatively discern people\u2019s attitudes and values, and reported in a user-friendly style.</li><li>Event management - that is customer focussed, efficient and flexible.\"\u00a0</li></ul><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>21st Century Dialogue has been involved with a wide range of engagement activities and deliberative processes in Western Australia in the past 15 years.</p><p>Their website includes an <a href=\"http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&amp;action=Index&amp;static=\">index of previous initiatives</a> which each have a detailed outline available.

Individuals, groups and members of civil society are often faced with material, epistemic and social threats to expressing, developing and publishing voices on social justice issues such as violence against religious minorities, missing and murdered Balochistani activists and academics and gendered violence.</p><p><strong>History/Overview</strong></p><p>Inspired by the revolutionary roots of the Pak Tea House in Lahore, The Second Floor Caf\u00e9 (T2F), founded in 2007, is a coffeeshop, bookstore, politico-cultural community space and alternative learning centre in Karachi, Pakistan dedicated to promoting democratic discourse and conflict resolution through intellectual and cultural engagement. PeaceNiche and T2F are founded by Sabeen Mahmud, a local and global activist, graphic designer/tech consultant, human rights advocate from Karachi who was murdered by an armed gunman on April 24 2015 after hosting the seminar \u201cUnsilencing Balochistan\u201d. It is the first of its kind in the nation, and has inspired many other caf\u00e9/community spaces to open up from Lahore to Lyari. Self-defined as a social entrepreneurship project, T2F relies on participation from local artists, activists, thought leaders and engaged audiences to revitalize Karachi\u2019s cultural and political landscapes by offering an alternative and space for discourse. It has and continues to provide space for local social movements and activists targeted by land mafias, the military and government such as Citizens Campaign to Reclaim Karachi and Balochi activist Mama Qadeer.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Mission:</strong></p><p>Its primary focus is 1) strengthening the voice of Pakistan\u2019s developing civil society through: 1) alleviation of intellectual poverty, 2) providing a platform for dialogue and creative expression, 3) social change through the arts, 4)development of a vibrant community of civic-minded citizens,5) supporting local entrepreneurship, 6)accessible early childhood education programming and 7)youth engagement. Towards this goal, some on-going projects at the T2F include Faraar, a visual arts gallery to promote local talent and social change through art, Science ka Adda, a platform for debate on the role and influence of science on our lives, Urdu Preservation Project, an archival project for urdu poetry and prose, and Raahnuma, an online resource for victims of violence and abuse.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Funding:</strong></p><p>It is funded as a branch of the PeaceNiche project, a not-for-profit organization in Karachi, Pakistan founded in hopes of creating a space for rational, creative and critical dialogue to counter growing religion-based violence, corruption, mafia-presence and extremism in Karachi. Though initially ran out of Mahmud\u2019s own pockets, after relocating to a donated rent-free space, maintenance and salaries are covered through different grants. The caf\u00e9 now operates on an honour code, where some individuals pay nothing and others donate generously.</p><p><strong>Membership:</strong></p><p>The caf\u00e9 has an open door, open mind policy and has hosted people from all walks of life willing to participate in democratic dialogue from students, elders, exiled leaders from skype, interfaith representatives, security and military professionals.</p><p><strong>Major Projects and Events</strong></p><p>The multi-purpose caf\u00e9 functions as a medium for mobilizing political resources, a community space for dialogue and deliberation and finally, as a site for preserving the intellectual and critical strain of Islamic and Pakistani traditions. The events hosted include everything from workshops/seminars on sectarian violence, state violence against and upon Balochistan, critiquing the blasphemy laws, critical and interfaith religious studies to stand up comedy and open mic shows. One event which illustrates how the caf\u00e9 mobilizes community members to solve civic problems is the Civic Hackathon in which developers, urban cartographers, data analysts, and designers/developers gathered to create web and mobile solutions to Pakistan\u2019s civic issues such as crime mapping to emergency services, disaster relief, and improving quality of education. Other programs include Philosophy 101, Traditional Music Preservation series\u00a0 and Zambeel Dramatic Reading group.</p><p><strong>Notes and Analysis:</strong></p><p>What separates T2F from other not-for-profits is its specific focus on developing civil society for the sake of building capacities for democracy through the relationships between citizens, especially relationships with marginalized members and voices in Pakistani society. This has democratic value in and of itself, building trust and solidarity between and across sectarian, ethnic and regional differences for more effective coalitional critiques against the state violence and corruption. Unlike in other countries, because of Pakistan\u2019s, and especially Karachi\u2019s, security situation, the cultural, artsy and critical nature of T2Fs activities and mission have not only a democratic function but also, a revolutionary aim to reclaim the city from the hands of the land mafia, the corrupt political parties and feudalist strife. One issue with the project is that because of the security situation, the activities and events are not broadcasted, publicized on a large national or even media scale. With the murder of the founder Sabeen Mahmud, the organization has a lot of political enemies/critics whose gaze must be avoided by the project. And so, most of its activities and their influence stays within a very local, off-the-radar, and directly in response to local communities of Karachi. Though its influence and capacity for social change may not directly bring about democratic social change at the level of the state,\u00a0 the caf\u00e9 is\u00a0 a space for cultural preservation and building agentic capacities through awareness/education, a place to retreat to from the violence, to become stronger for the tougher political landscapes and climates outside, and to-come.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Secondary sources/External Links</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://codeforpakistan.org/programs/civic-hackathons/karachi-civic-hackathon/\">http://codeforpakistan.org/programs/civic-hackathons/karachi-civic-hackathon/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://universalistmuslims.tumblr.com/post/117430599022/sabeen-mahmud-founder-of-the-ngo-peace-niche-and\">http://universalistmuslims.tumblr.com/post/117430599022/sabeen-mahmud-founder-of-the-ngo-peace-niche-and</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/karima-bennoune/in-memory-of-sabeen-mahmud-\">https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/karima-bennoune/in-memory-of-sabeen-mahmud-\u201ci-stand-up-for-what-i-believe-in-but-i-can\u2019t-fight-</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/INOV_a_00185\">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/INOV_a_00185</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.t2f.biz\">http://www.t2f.biz</a></p><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "Karachi", "tags": "freedom of expression||art||culture||Democratic Experimentation||activism", "geo_province": "Sindh", "title_en": "The Second Floor Cafe", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/second-floor-cafe", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "169032", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"563065_10150788451273619_933637376_n.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": "University or Research", "updated_date": "2016-07-30T04:27:28", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Mr. Javed Nawaz", "post_date": "2016-07-18T22:56:26", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4487", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Economic Development||Community Development||Poverty Reduction||Environment||Health||Higher Education &amp; Lifelong Learning||Human Rights||Gender &amp; Racial Equality||Identity &amp; Diversity||International Trade &amp; Global Economy||Law Enforcement, Criminal Justice, &amp; Corrections||National &amp; International Security||International Aid &amp; Development||Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)||Science &amp; Technology||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<p><strong>History and Mission</strong></p><p>Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) is an independent, not-for-profit, non-partisan research institute dedicated to facilitating research-based, objective critiques on policy, institutions and political activity in Pakistan.

What inspired this group into creation was the Zina Ordinance\u2019s application to the case of Fehmida and Allah Bux which conflated adultery with rape. Within months of its founding, chapters of WAF opened up in Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar. WAF was the face of feminism in Pakistan in the 80s, with picketing, demonstrations, processions, rallies, signature campaigns, consciousness-raising, telegrams, and writing memorandums and letters as their forms of protest and contestation. The organizations current goals include women\u2019s representation in parliament, consciousness-raising in regards to family planning, and making public statements on women\u2019s issues. Though Membership was once mostly women from elite, upper class families, it now includes women from different backgrounds, in different regions.</p><p><strong>Analysis and criticism:</strong></p><p>As one of the first organizations to apologize to Bangladeshi women for the crimes against humanity from the 1971 war, to deliberatively deciding to advocate for a secular, democratic nation state, WAF is an intersectional, inclusive and feminist organization. WAF is known as one of the last remaining autonomous, political and women\u2019s rights organizations in Pakistan that has not been hijacked by the neoliberal development agenda. Paid-rights activism, especially when it comes to women\u2019s development, is becoming heavily critiqued in Pakistan.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LZK-2.pdf\">http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LZK-2.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/pakistan/12453.pdf\">http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/pakistan/12453.pdf</a></p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": "Radical Feminism||Consciousness-raising||protest", "geo_province": "", "title_en": "Women's Action Forum (WAF)", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/womens-action-forum-waf", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "169032", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{\"src\": \"protest%20lahore.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2016-07-30T04:38:41", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "Ghari Shahu,", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2016-07-30T02:30:28", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "54000", "id": "4519", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "AWP Secretariate; Opposite Taj cinema, Ghari Shahu, Lahore, 54000, Pakistan", "geo_country": "Pakistan", "content_country": "Pakistan", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Education &amp; Schools||Community Development||Poverty Reduction||Human Rights||Gender &amp; Racial Equality||Identity &amp; Diversity||Political Institutions (e.g. Constitutions, Legal Systems, Electoral Systems)", "body_en": "<p><strong>Organization</strong>: Awami Workers\u2019 Party</p><p><strong>History </strong></p><p>Awami Workers\u2019 Party is a political party of the working people which aims to bring together the struggles of workers, peasants, students, women and other marginalized communities in the democratic claims-making process.

The association self-identifies as a nationally-organized resistance to the arbitrary eviction and force homelessness of the urban poor, displaced persons and ethnic/religious minorities. It also advocates for affordable housing for low-income families. Its workers do consciousness-raising and provide social, political and legal education and facilitate peaceful mobilization for housing and land reform</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Due to the rise in post-conflict migration, unprecedented degree of economic growth and increase in poverty, informal living arrangments of more than 40 homes named katchi abadis are expanding in Pakistan's major cities. \u00a0The settlements are homes to the most marginalized, economically and socially, members of Pakistani society from ethnic minorities to low-income families. The communities house mostly workers who provide critical labour to local economies but are undervalued, underpaid and denied basic rights to shelter, fair wages, water and education. The livelihoods of the residents is under constant arbitrary threat by state violence and evictions.\u00a0</p><p>The National Housing Policy 2001 demands that existing katchi abadis be regularized and upgraded, the dwellers be granted ownership rights of the land they occupy and the Capital Development Authority provide basic services of water, electricity and gas. However, the CDA only recognizes 10 settlements as of yet and continues to ignore the no-eviction clause of the 2001 Housing Policy</p><p><strong>Specializations and activities</strong></p><p>The association works with over 14 katchi abadis, with a population of over 150,000 in the nation's capital, Islamabad, in coalition with the Awami Workers' Party. The association works to: 1)consciousness/awareness raising, 2)organization, 3)facilitate communication and dialogue and 4)influence decision-making at local and national levels.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Major projects and events</strong></p><p>According to their official Facebook Page, the APKAA is involved in the following activities:</p><p>1) Organize regular meetings,</p><p>organizes regular meetings, discussions and work sessions with groups of men and women in different abadis that focus on the following activities:</p><p>\"a. Disseminating information about past and present government policies, actions and initiatives.<br />b. Dialogue about the economic, social and political power structures that exist in the country and beyond.\u00a0<br />c. Raising awareness about the political and legal rights of the abadi residents, as slum-dwellers and citizens of Pakistan.<br />d. Outlining the need for peaceful social, political and community organization beyond religious, sectarian, ethnic and gender differences.\"</p><p>2) The organization also helps residents strenghten existing forms of community organization to contest illegal attempts of eviction by building a \"sustainable organizational structure for the future defense of their rights and positioning of their lawful demands\". APKAA works to create dialogue between abadi residents, civil society, students, academics and other social movements by creating spaces for discussion, joint-lobbying strategies and mobilization.</p><p>3)APKAA has a special commitment to strenghtening the abilities of youth and women's groups to use means of communication to express themselves and disseminate information such as wall painting, informative pamphlets and social media technologies.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>4)The association seeks to influence government decision-making through protests, organized demonstrations and legal claims. Its current agenda involves organizing a rally on land rights in conversation with the Supreme Court's hearing on the Awami Workers' Party's petition' for a judicial review on previous rulings of land reform. \u00a0This is a coalitional effort between katchi abadi residents of Islamabad and the landless farmers of Punjab.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The next few years for the organization will consist of entering local and provincial politics through the electoral system in hopes of amplifying voices that represent the needs of the Pakistan's poorest.</p><p><strong>Funding</strong></p><p>Its activities are funded by donors and local supporters of the Awami Workers' Party.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AllianceforKachiAbadis/info?tab=page_info\">https://www.facebook.com/AllianceforKachiAbadis/info?tab=page_info</a></p><h3><a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1275518\">http://www.dawn.com/news/1275518</a></h3><p><a href=\"http://awamiworkersparty.org/campaigns/katchi-abadi-timeline/\">http://awamiworkersparty.org/campaigns/katchi-abadi-timeline/</a></p>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "", "title_en": "All-Pakistani Alliance for Katchi Abadis", "methods": null, "path": "/organizations/all-pakistani-alliance-katchi-abadis", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "169032", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2016-08-14T17:14:37", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Carmen Rosen", "post_date": "2016-08-14T17:14:37", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4541", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Canada", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Arts &amp; Culture||Environment||Identity &amp; Diversity", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Publications</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://stillmoon.org/\">http://stillmoon.org/</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "geo_city": "Vancouver", "tags": null, "geo_province": "British Columbia", "title_en": "Still Moon Arts Society", "methods": "Participatory Arts||Collaborative Planning", "path": "/organizations/still-moon-arts-society", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "110904", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": "Non-Profit or Non Governmental", "updated_date": "2016-09-15T20:08:43", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": "Geoff Cape", "post_date": "2016-08-15T22:17:00", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4544", "description": null, "video": "4575", "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "Canada", "content_country": "Canada", "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": "Education &amp; Schools||Community Development||Environment||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)", "body_en": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>The Evergreen Foundation is dedicated to \u201cinspiring action to green cities\u201d through research, design and collaborative initiatives. By improving the interconnections and interdependencies between people, nature, and the built world, Evergreen helps cities thrive in a sustainable manner. According to the group\u2019s vision, \u201cinvolving people directly in the process of restoring the health of local ecologies and their communities positively affects the attitudes and behaviours that lie at the core of the sustainable city\u201d (About Evergreen).</p><h3>History</h3><p>The Evergreen Foundation is a Canadian charity and international thought leader established in 1991. For over 25 years Evergreen has been working in collaboration with diverse communities using a systems approach which recognizes people, places and environmental issues as \u201cpart of interdependent, complex social and economic systems\u201d (About Evergreen). In total over 200 000 volunteers have devoted more than 600 000 hours to Evergreen\u2019s programs; greening public spaces and leading various projects in their communities. Their goal to turn innovative ideas into actionable projects is sought through a mix of engagement strategies; playful and optimistic yet empowering and designed to initiate change. Throughout their history Evergreen has and continues to be dedicated to the principle of accountability; ensuring that the delivery of programs is up to the standard of the communities and those who put in time and effort are rewarded in kind.</p><p><em>By the numbers:</em></p><ul><li>600 000 hours put in by over 200 000 volunteers</li><li>Over 1 million children in 25% of Canadian schools reached through the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds and 70,000 kids enrolled in Evergreen Brick Works outdoor learning</li><li>Over 500 community recipients of Evergreen grants and partnerships</li><li>1, 511, 692 trees, shrubs and other greenery planted and close to 4 million square metres naturalized across Canada</li><li>Almost $5 million invested in the local food economy and 686, 542 pounds of food harvested from community gardens (Our Impact)</li></ul><h3>Specializations and Activities</h3><p>Evergreen has three areas of focus: Greenspace, Children, Food, and CityWorks.</p><p><em><u>1. Greenspace</u></em></p><p>Greenspace is Evergreen\u2019s chiefly environmental program helping to connect the people with the ecosystems they live in. The program encompasses four areas: community greening, partner projects with municipals and communities, restoring urban watersheds, and enhancing Toronto\u2019s Lower Don Valley (see \u201cMajor Projects\u201d section of this article).</p><p>i. Community Greening</p><p>Community greening events take place all over the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island providing individuals, families and friends the opportunity to volunteer their time to increase the sustainability and restore the natural beauty of their neighbourhoods. Working in public parks and natural areas, community greening volunteers engage in various activities such as \u201cplanting trees, monitoring wildlife and removing invasive plant species.\u201d The organization sees that its volunteers</p><ul><li>\u201cMeet like-minded people in [their] community</li><li>Make a positive impact on the environment</li><li>Learn about the benefits of planting native trees and shrubs</li><li>Learn how to identify invasive species and how to remove them</li><li>Plant trees for future generations to enjoy</li><li>Have fun!\u201d (Community Greening).</li></ul><p>Currently, there are multiple greening projects in the works, the calendar for which can be accessed by clicking here.</p><p>ii. Municipal and Community Partnerships</p><p>Greenspace\u2019s work wouldn\u2019t be possible without the strong ties Evergreen has developed with local municipalities, communities and community organizations, and other land managers. Through these partnerships, Greenspace has been given access to unique natural spaces and support in raising awareness and getting more individuals involved in the reinvigoration of their environments. Through these support networks, Evergreen\u2019s initiatives are producing long-term, sustainable impacts.</p><p>iii. Restoring Urban Watersheds</p><p>Watersheds are defined as \u201carea[s] of land where all of the water that is under it or on the surface of it goes to the same place\u201d (Restoring Urban Watersheds). Urban watersheds in the Metro Vancouver Area and the Greater Toronto Area face degradation from civil infrastructure projects such as roads and buildings. As well, <em>stormwater</em> \u2013 the runoff from urban areas \u2013 flows downstream into these bodies of water, carrying with it various toxins and contaminants. Part of Evergreen\u2019s Greenspace endeavour focusses on the restoration of these watersheds as well as increasing urban biodiversity and measuring the impact of urban development on urban streams.</p><p>To accomplish these goals, Evergreen and its community and municipal partners \u201cremove invasive plants, reintroduce native plants, monitor water quality and learn about the importance of our local streams\u201d (Ibid.). \u00a0For example, the organization\u2019s work on biodiversity is helped by the Invasive Species Council of Metro Vancouver and Ontario\u2019s Invasive Species Awareness Program which, in use with Evergreen\u2019s Native Plant Database, can help community members identify and remove or replace invasive and damaging plant species. As well, Evergreen\u2019s \u201cUncover Your Creeks\u201d program on the coast of BC has sixteen different monitoring sites which are used by volunteers and community members to track the quality of water. The data from this project helps Evergreen understand the impacts of urban development on these streams, to develop interventions and, ultimately, to mitigate the harmful aspects of this process. (See \u201cMajor Projects\u201d section of this article for further information).\u00a0</p><p>Finally, the urban watersheds program is focussed on climate change mitigation and adaptation defined as \u201cactions taken to respond to the impacts of climate change by taking advantage of opportunities or reducing the associated risks\u201d (Restoring Urban Watersheds). The Metro Vancouver Area and the Greater Toronto Area are both expected to feel the effects of climate change in terms of increasingly severe and frequent rainfall \u2013 both of which \u201ccan mean damage to infrastructure and public property, and health impacts due to wastewater contamination in water bodies\u201d (Ibid.). Since there are a variety of ways communities and individuals can get involved in climate change adaptation Evergreen, with support from the Intact Foundation, \u201cis connecting residents with opportunities for climate adaption in their watersheds through the Community Climate Adaptation Initiative\u201d more information about which can be found by click here. As well, on a municipal level, Evergreen recently supported the Vancouver Parks Board\u2019s Master Plan for the restoration of Still Creek (see \u201cProjects and Activities\u201d section of this article for a more in-depth account).</p><p><em><u>2. Children</u></em></p><p>As our world moves more online, our children are spending more times indoors, less time exercising and developing a sense of community with their peers. Evergreen is determined to change this worrying trend by offering young Canadians a variety of ways to engage with the natural world, \u201cto learn and to engage their senses,\u00a0to explore and to discover their surroundings,\u00a0and to challenge their minds and bodies\u201d (Children). Four areas make up this ambitious initiative: the greening of school grounds, programs for learning and playing outdoors, leadership opportunities, and year-round day camps. \u00a0</p><p>i. Greening School Grounds</p><p>Evergreen\u2019s work on school grounds involves balancing the natural with the built world; creating an environment that meets the functional needs of the classroom while offering kids \u201cdifferent looks, sensory experiences and play opportunities in every\u00a0season\u201d (Greening School Grounds). Evergreen brings the influence of naturally occurring features into the planning and design process which creates diverse landscapes for children to explore and discover.</p><p>Evergreen takes a one-on-one approach to their school greening initiatives, working closely with each school board to draw up the optimal design for their location, resource allotment, goals and needs. Currently, the organization works with 13 school boards and districts as well as the Nova Scotia Department of Education and Early Development but encourages any interested citizen or school to become involved through the national network of Evergreen planning experts who provide assistance with:</p><ul><li>\u201cApprovals processes \u2013 creating clear lines of communication and accountability within the school board</li><li>Guidance through a participatory design process \u2013 resulting in coordination between the school board, school administrators, facilities staff, external suppliers, parents and the broader community</li><li>Planning support for project installations \u2013 preventing costly mistakes in school-ground modifications and creating high-quality, safe and lasting project designs</li><li>Design guidelines \u2013 providing clarity for all project stakeholders and creating significant efficiencies</li><li>Education and training \u2013 supporting schools in the use of and care for their new spaces, and providing the motivation for engaging students in both.\u201d (School Board Collaborations &amp; Services)</li></ul><p>In addition to offering expert collaboration, Evergreen offers a number of grant opportunities to schools which you can read more about in the \u201cFunding\u201d section of this article.</p><p>ii. Outdoor Learning and Playing</p><p>Learning through hands-on experience is vital to childhood education and, thankfully, the natural world provides plenty of opportunity to do so. Evergreen is dedicated to ensuring kids have the ability to explore and discover their environment so offers school and home-based activity ideas to educators, parents and guardians through workshops, school programming and publications.</p><p>The Watershed Champions program is an example of the kinds of outdoor learning initiatives Evergreen encourages schools to offer their students. Schools compete for the \u201cRBC\u2013Evergreen Watershed Champions Award\u201d by learning about, caring for and spreading awareness around their local watersheds. More information on the award is found in the \u201cFunding\u201d section of this article.</p><p>Another example of Evergreen\u2019s work in this area is the \u201cAll Hands in the Dirt Forum\u201d: an annual meeting of education, administration and design experts to discuss best practices and new innovations in the area of outdoor learning. Past forums have included workshops, activities and small-group discussions on topics such as</p><ul><li>\u201cAddressing questions of risky play in the outdoors</li><li>Increasing and improving learning opportunities in children\u2019s outdoor spaces</li><li>Unpacking policies and practices for children\u2019s outdoor spaces</li><li>Designing for child development and increased physical activity</li><li>Evaluation and assessment for teaching outdoors\u201d (All Hands in the Dirt Forum).</li></ul><p>iii. Youth Leadership</p><p>The Evergreen Foundation believes that \u201ca key component is having the opportunity to develop skills and gain experience in nature while becoming the stewards of the environment we\u2019ll need for tomorrow\u201d (Youth Leadership). Together with community organizations Evergreen offers a number of youth leadership programs which emphasize hands-on learning and teamwork. The Community Bicycle Hub Project is a great example of the social-enterprising abilities youth can gain through these activities. After learning to fix donated bikes, participants return to their communities and pass on their acquired skills. Similarly, youth involved in the Healthy Choices program work together to \u201cmake healthy food choices for themselves, their communities and the planet\u201d (Ibid.). Community and teamwork are also key aspects of the Aboriginal Visiting High Schools project: a collaborative effort between Evergreen and schools groups to facilitate the transfer of traditional knowledge between elders, members of the Aboriginal community, and youth.</p><p>Alongside these programs is the yearly HSBC-Evergreen Youth Action Series, a week-long series of events \u201cexploring ecology, green living, stewardship and green infrastructure all while offering youth the opportunity to network with others who are stewards of the environment\u201d (HSBC\u2013Evergreen Youth Action Series). In 2016, the event will be held in five different cities in Canada: Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Details of what kinds of activities will be offered and how you can get involved can be found here <a href=\"https://www.evergreen.ca/our-impact/children/youth-leadership/hsbc-evergreen-youth-action-series/\">https://www.evergreen.ca/our-impact/children/youth-leadership/hsbc-evergreen-youth-action-series/</a></p><p>Finally, Evergreen holds leadership training programs for its summer camps (discussed below). Leaders-in Training and Assistant Counsellors are each offered two week training programs that serve as valuable volunteer hours for school.</p><p>iv. Day Camps</p><p>Evergreen is proud to offer five different day camp experiences at their Brick Works facility in Toronto: Nature Nut Kids' Club, Sprouts Parent and Tot Play, PA Day Camps, Homeschool Program, March Break Day Camp, Green City Adventure Camp, and Winter Camps. Each day camp is focussed on giving children the ability to experience and explore the natural, \u2018greener\u2019 side of Toronto through outdoor play. Designed to educate the next generation of inspired environmental stewards, each program is planned according to the following principles:</p><ul><li>\u201cPlace Based \u2013 building a foundation of knowledge through a focus on local nature, culture and community.</li><li>Ecological \u2013 providing children direct contact with nature.</li><li>Hands-on \u2013 creating a setting for compelling learning through multi-sensory, direct experiences.</li><li>Active and mobile \u2013 moving the body to engage the mind.</li><li>Arts-infused \u2013 breathing life into learning through creativity, compelling narratives and arts activities.</li><li>Integrated \u2013 weaving together knowledge and skill through ecological themes and engaging experiences.\u201d (Evergreen Brick Works Day Camps).</li></ul><p>More information on the each of the different day camps can be found at <a href=\"https://www.evergreen.ca/our-impact/children/day-camps/\">https://www.evergreen.ca/our-impact/children/day-camps/</a></p><p><em><u>3. Food</u></em></p><p>Evergreen\u2019s approach to food is simple: good food = happy people and healthy cities. By supporting local farms, encouraging the growth of food in cities, and working to improve the eating and living habits of everyday citizens, Evergreen is making a change in the way we sustain ourselves.</p><p>i. Supporting Local Farms</p><p>Globalization has caused a fundamental disconnect between consumers and the producers of their food. Evergreen believes that the re-establishing this connection is key to creating a sustainable food system, \u201cpreserv[ing] the health of our cities, the integrity of our environment and the strength of our communities\u201d (Supporting Local Farms). To initiate this, Evergreen has committed itself to the following guiding principles:</p><ul><li>\u201cAccessibility:\u00a0A farmers' market and food programs that are accessible to diverse audiences.</li><li>Collaborative Infrastructure:\u00a0Build relationships with other like-minded organizations and community groups, as well as the community at large.</li><li>Innovation:\u00a0Foster and celebrate innovation at our farmers' market and in the design and delivery of our food programs.</li><li>Education:\u00a0Create an experiential, hands-on approach to the delivery of our food programs.</li><li>Replicability:\u00a0Establish models that can be replicated locally and nationally.\u201d (Ibid.)</li></ul><p>In order to accomplish these goals, Evergreen encourages its partners, volunteers, community members and interested citizens to:</p><ul><li>Shop at the Farmer\u2019s Market located in Evergreen\u2019s own Brick Works facility in Toronto</li><li>Engage in Evergreen\u2019s Community Supported Agriculture program (more information here)</li><li>Visit the Farmer\u2019s Markets Canada website to find local producers outside the Toronto area</li></ul><p>ii. Growing Food in the City</p><p>Creating a sustainable food network starts at the community level \u2013 whether it\u2019s sourcing food directly from your local producer or growing your own. The Evergreen foundation offers two programs designed to make the food growing process easy even for the apartment-bound city dweller.</p><p>For those living in Toronto, the Urban Agriculture program at the Evergreen Brick Works showcases new innovations in do-it-yourself food production. The easily replicable food gardens offer everything from organic vegetables to edible flowers while the greenhouse \u201cfeatures raised-bed food gardening, various organic agricultural techniques and window farms to showcase a \u201cfull circle\u201d approach to seasonal food-growing in urban areas\u201d (Growing Food). Similarly, grow tubes demonstrate how nutritious food can be grown in cold climates using very little light. Evergreen\u2019s dedicated compost-experts volunteer their time as \u2018worm wranglers\u2019, imparting the wisdom of \u201cat-home composting, the benefits of waste management and the importance of healthy soil to all visitors at Evergreen Brick Works\u201d (Ibid.). Finally, both the Seniors Garden and the Cooking Classrooms offer visitors the opportunity to engage hands-on in the food growing (and eating!) process.</p><p>iii. Healthy Eating and Active Living</p><p>Cities and communities are only as healthy as their citizens so Evergreen has made it its mission to encourage individuals across the country to develop healthy eating and active lifestyles. Workshops and educational events make it easy for anyone \u2013 big eaters or small \u2013 to learn how to create hassle-free, healthy meals using local ingredients. Seniors Community Kitchen at the Brick Works brings seniors and youth together with Evergreen staff to \u201cshare skills and knowledge, socialize and prepare seasonal, nutritious meals together\u201d (Healthy Eating &amp; Active Living). As well, Evergreen experts work with Community Kitchens in the Greater Toronto Area to discuss everything from fundraising strategies and buying on a budget to food justice and increasing the kitchen\u2019s food gardening capabilities. Check the calendar for events happening across the country here: <a href=\"https://www.evergreen.ca/whats-on/\">https://www.evergreen.ca/whats-on/</a></p><p>The Healthy Choices initiative is Evergreen\u2019s way of engaging directly with communities \u201cto share meals, celebrate food and build life-long skills, and invite a wide range of groups to connect with our passionate and expert staff\u201d (Healthy Eating &amp; Active Living). As well, the Healthy Choices initiative also offers youth-specific programs (see \u201cChildren\u201d section of this article). \u00a0</p><p><em><u>4. City Works</u></em></p><p>City design and civil infrastructure planning have profound effects on the way inhabitants live and interact as well as the natural environment they displace or overlap. Evergreen\u2019s City Works initiative engages the public, innovators, designers and decision makers to reduce the large-scale environmental impact of our cities \u2013 from city-building to housing to transportation, Evergreen \u201cbelieve[s] that transformative change can happen when Canadians are engaged with new ideas, in ways that are relevant to them\u201d (City Works).</p><p>i. City Building</p><p>Sustainable development is complicated by accelerated urbanization and aging infrastructure \u2013 Evergreen\u2019s City Building initiative brings leading research and design to its collaborative work with city planners and communities to help develop a clear vision for the future. It is Evergreen\u2019s hope that this vision combined with local, national and global action will mitigate the risks our human and environmental health face by building cities with smaller carbon footprints and more sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>Evergreen\u2019s City Building department has just finished two projects \u2013100in1day Canada and Project Green Bloc in Vancouver \u2013 and is involved in two other ongoing initiatives: the Hamilton City Building Action Campaign and \u201cWe Are Cities\u201d. Information on all these projects is available in the \u201cMajor Projects and Events\u201d section of this article.</p><p>ii. Housing</p><p>Global rises in urbanization demand a rethinking of housing infrastructure. By 2036, the population of the Greater Toronto Area is expected to by more than 9 million and it is therefore imperative that and integrated approach to housing is generated, \u201cone that is more sustainable, affordable and equitable\u201d (Housing). Evergreen believes that through the building of \u201ccollaborative capacity and co-created solutions\u201d, a green future for Toronto\u2019s housing systems may be developed.</p><p>By testing these ideas on a local scale, Evergreen hopes to deploy proven sustainable housing strategies across Canada where appropriate. The GTA Housing Action Lab is the real-life testing ground for these new innovations. The Toronto area is facing many of the same urban housing problems faced by other cities across the nation and, indeed, across the globe. Specifically, some of these challenges include lack of affordability especially for lower income households; environmental degradation from automotive travel; lack of social housing and affordable repair options; and a growing disparity between \u201cdevelopment patterns and regional growth and transportation planning. The GTA Housing Action Lab aims to collaboratively develop</p><ul><li>\u201cPrograms and policies that\u00a0support the affordability of housing\u00a0to ensure residents of all incomes have the best chance to live in a suitable home and have a choice in their housing</li><li>A more sustainable housing system in the region by\u00a0increasing public support for intensification, awareness of the benefits of complete communities, and policies that support creative infill in our urban centres and a connected region</li><li>A policy and regulatory framework that\u00a0encourages diversity in form and tenure, intensification and affordability, and creates incentives aligned with the needs of the residents of the region while creating an economically viable housing sector\u201d (GTA Housing Action Lab)</li></ul><p>Another project Evergreen\u2019s City Works is involved in is \u201cTower Renewal\u201d, more information about which can be found in the \u201cMajor Projects and Events\u201d section of this article.</p><p>iii. Transportation</p><p>Transporting people and goods across the country accounts for 27% of Canada\u2019s emissions. The ability to move sustainably is under pressure from increasingly dense, sprawling urban populations. Evergreen\u2019s work on transportation recognizes the need for creativity and vision to come up with new forms of travel and, therefore, its projects such as \u201cMove the GTHA\u201d and the \u201cTrafficJam Hackathon\u201d focus on engaging Canadians in discussion and debate on this important topic. More information on these projects is available in the following section, \u201cMajor Projects and Events\u201d. \u00a0</p><h3>Major Projects and Events</h3><p><em><u>Uncover Your Creeks</u></em></p><p>One of the Evergreen Foundation\u2019s major projects is the \u201cUncover Your Creeks\u201d initiative which helps monitor urban streams in Metro Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area. Recently, the Evergreen Foundation was involved in the restoration Master Plan of Vancouver\u2019s Still Creek. Evergreen took a leading role, engaging with local governments and members of the public and undertaking rehabilitation activities such as riparian planting (Tyler Carlson). As well, the ongoing data collection and monitoring of the stream was made possible through a partnership with the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) H2O project. CURA H20 works with various government and community partners in Canada and abroad to \u201cbuild capacity within stewardship organizations through a variety of resources and training, and to address the lack of consistency by standardizing data collection at the community level via the Wet-Pro training program\u201d (About CURA H20). In this case, CURA H2O and Evergreen are helping the community monitor the health of its stream and take measures when needed without the need for government intervention. A full case study of the Still Creek project is available on Participedia at <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/stream-management-watershed-governance-collaborative-restoration-vancouver-s-still-creek\">http://participedia.net/en/cases/stream-management-watershed-governance-collaborative-restoration-vancouver-s-still-creek</a></p><p><em><u>Lower Don Project</u></em></p><p>The Don River Valley is located in the heart of Toronto\u2019s East York district and is currently home to 250k residents with an expected increase of 80k in the coming years. The Lower Don Greenway is accessible through 5km of trails yet few residents are aware of the diverse natural ecosystem located right in their backyard. Public green spaces \u201ccreate livable communities and promote personal, social, cultural and environmental health\u201d and it is therefore Evergreen\u2019s mission to revitalize the Lower Don trail. Working in collaboration with partners such as the City of Toronto and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Evergreen has planned a variety of improvements to \u201c-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 allow residents and visitors to better enjoy and appreciate the wonders of this remarkable ravine corridor\u201d (Lower Don Project):</p><ul><li>New gateways and access points</li><li>Pedestrian and cycling trail enhancements</li><li>Restored green spaces</li><li>New public art and educational programs</li></ul><p>For more information on the project please see the \u201cExternal Links\u201d section of this article.</p><p><em><u>100in1day Canada </u></em></p><p>100in1day is a global movement started in 2012 by a group of design students in Colombia. What began as an albeit ambitious plan to launch 100 urban interventions in one day produced a world-wide phenomenon. The original event in May of 2012 returned an unanticipated 250 interventions and since then 100in1day has been held in 31 cities around the world. Evergreen is proud to have led 100in1day Canada which occurred on June 4, 2016 in six cities: Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Hamilton, Montreal and Halifax and initiated 580 citizen-developed building ideas. More information on each of the projects and next year\u2019s events can be found in the \"External Links\".\u00a0</p><p><em><u>Project Green Bloc in Vancouver </u></em></p><p>Project Green Bloc was started as a three-year project with the ambitious aim to \u201cfill the gap between individual level and city-level change and forge a strong bloc of neighbours, willing to take action individually and collectively to mitigate climate change and unsustainable levels of consumption out of a random group of residents who just happened to live on the same city block\u201d (Project Green Bloc). To accomplish this, Evergreen worked with the residents of Vancouver\u2019s Riley Park neighbourhood to lessen the community\u2019s ecological footprint by 25% through local action and behavioural change. Four main components made up the project:</p><ol><li>Research to measure household and neighbourhood ecological footprints</li><li>Carefully structured community consultation and dialogue</li><li>Cooperative local greening and sustainability initiatives</li><li>Activities to build community cohesion and social inclusion</li></ol><p>By the end of the three years, the neighbourhood had collectively reduced their ecological footprint by 12% but legacy projects such street greening and traffic calming ensure a long-term dedication to their sustainable living goals. For an executive summary of this project please see <a href=\"https://www.evergreen.ca/downloads/pdfs/GreenBloc_ExecutiveSummary.pdf\">https://www.evergreen.ca/downloads/pdfs/GreenBloc_ExecutiveSummary.pdf</a> and the \u201cExternal Links\u201d section of this page.</p><p><em><u>The Hamilton City Building Action Campaign </u></em></p><p>Hamilton is experiencing a period of urban revitalization and cultural renaissance and, in order both accelerate and sustain this, Evergreen CityWorks is collaborating with their partners planningAliance, the Hamilton Communication Foundation and the City of Hamilton to initiate the multi-year Hamilton City Building Action Campaign. The campaign consists of five elements focussed on \u201cwork[ing] with the community in shaping the city\u2019s future, connect[ing] plans and policies while also catalyzing on-the-ground results\u201d (Hamilton City Building Action Campaign).</p><p>1. Outreach, Engagement and Collaboration \u2013 bringing a diverse selection of residents and stakeholders into the discussion</p><p>2. Priority Scanning and Mapping the City \u2013 meetings with various players in the community revealed an overwhelming consensus that focus should be placed on \u201ctangible actions and specific urban interventions\u201d (Hamilton City Building Action Campaign).</p><p>3. West Harbour Engagement Strategy \u2013 discussing the future of the West Harbour neighbourhood with its residents, local community groups and organizations, stakeholders and Lura Consulting. These discussions will in turn be used to inform future communication strategies between city officials and community residents.</p><p>4. Next Generation City Builders \u2013 Imagine My Sustainable Hamilton (IMSH) \u2013 a four-day program intended to bring ecological awareness and sustainable city-building to grade 7 classroom in over 15 schools. As well, students are constructing 3D models of their visions for their future neighbourhoods with the help of the art collective No. 9 in collaboration with the Hamilton Wentworth District School Board (HWDSB) and local architects and artists.</p><p>5.

The project is crowdsourcing ideas from Canadians for an action plan as well as helping to support current initiatives. To date, \u201cthere have been over 50 roundtables in 25 cities across 10 provinces, over 175 ideas have been submitted online\u201d and the foundation has created the new \u201cWe Are Cities: Community Innovation Grant\u201d to helping progress local projects (We Are Cities).</p><p><em><u>Tower Renewal </u></em></p><p>The Tower Renewal project began in 2007 in response to the deterioration of Ontario\u2019s Greater Golden Horseshoe concrete apartment blocks. Situated in marginalized neighbourhoods with few amenities and limited access to transport, the 2,000 aging, energy inefficient towers represent 20% of Toronto\u2019s housing stock and are home to nearly 1 million people. Recognizing the need for intervention, Graeme Stewart and Michael McClelland of ERA Architects initiated the renewal project which, thanks to the Centre for Urban Growth and Renewal and the City of Toronto, encompasses three processes:</p><ul><li>\u201cAn energy retrofit of existing buildings</li><li>Improved livability for renters and their surrounding communities through increased social and economic opportunities within tower neighbourhoods</li><li>Better use of the green space around these towers through mixed-use infill development and improved transit connections to and from these neighbourhoods\u201d (Tower Renewal).</li></ul><p>Through these efforts it is hoped that the towers are transformed from \u201cisolated and often socially marginalized dormitories into dynamic, integrated and low-carbon hubs across the city\u201d (Tower Renewal).</p><p><em><u>Move the GTHA</u></em></p><p>Back in 2011, a number of community organizations were brought together by Evergreen CityWorks and the Toronto Atmospheric fund to discuss the possibility of forming a collaboration. By working together it was hoped that these organizations would be able to raise public awareness and increase support for transit infrastructure. Subsequently, \u201cMove the GTHA\u201d was born in September 2012 and now has 12 core members and 16 supporting organizations. Together and with the input of everyday transport users and area residents, the collective hopes to achieve \u201clong-term dedicated funding for an efficient, accessible, affordable and fully integrated regional transportation system, with accountable and effective regional governance mechanisms for that transportation system\u201d (About Move the GTHA).</p><p><em><u>TrafficJam Hackathon </u></em></p><p>As part of Toronto\u2019s TrafficJam Expo in October, Evergreen CityWorks and the City of Toronto have called on 150 \u201cengaged citizens, digital creatives and data detectives\u201d to team up \u201clocal traffic analysts, government officials and data collectors to brainstorm new ideas, analyze data and build tools that will kickstart the development of real solutions\u201d (TrafficJam Hackathon). Prizes will be handed out to the most promising submissions by Mayor John Tory on October 4.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p><em><u>Funding for Evergreen</u></em></p><p>Evergreen has numerous public and private sponsors and supporters, a full list of which is available at <a href=\"https://www.evergreen.ca/about/supporters/\">https://www.evergreen.ca/about/supporters/</a></p><p>National Partner: Toyota Canada Inc. and its Dealerships have worked with the foundation for over 12 years, distributed more than $2.8 million in grants to over 2,350 schools and day cares with an estimated impact on over 1 million students and close to 100,000 school faculty members.\u00a0</p><p>Lead Partner: the Government of Ontario with its various ministries has partnered with Evergreen since the foundation\u2019s inception.

Through the platform, users can register to take part in polls, discussions, and budgeting decisions. The website also provides citizens with a detailed calendar of participatory events happening around the state.</p><h3>History</h3><p>The YourSAy platform was first used in 2010 during an update to the state-wide Strategic Plan. The initiative, South Australia's largest community engagement initiative to date, sought input from over 9000 residents through a mix of face-to-face and online interactions. Since then, YourSay has been used in over 100 different initiatives - from cycling law revisions to wildlife management.\u00a0</p><h3>Specializations and Activities</h3><p>YourSAy is primarily an online consultation platform although it describes itself as a community \"hub\" providing information and support for feedback on in-person consultations and various community engagement opportunities.\u00a0</p><h3>Major Projects and Events</h3><p>With over 100 engagements under its belt, YourSAy has become the defacto hub of citizen-government interaction. A full list of past initiatives can be found <a href=\"http://yoursay.sa.gov.au/decisions/past\">here</a>.</p><p>There are several in-depth case studies of initiatives using the YourSAy platform available on Participedia:</p><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/south-australias-country-cabinets\">South Australia's Country Cabinets</a></p><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/sharing-roads-safely-south-australian-citizens-jury\">Sharing the Roads Safely: a South Australian Citizens' Jury</a></p><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/get-know-nuclear-nuclear-fuel-cycle-engagement-south-australia\">Get to know Nuclear: Nuclear Fuel Cycle engagement in South Australia</a></p><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/creating-safe-and-vibrant-adelaide-nightlife\">Creating a Safe and Vibrant Adelaide Nightlife</a></p><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/dog-and-cat-management-south-australia\">Dog and Cat Management (South Australia)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/infrastructure-victoria-engagement-process\">Infrastructure Victoria Engagement Process</a></p><h3>Funding</h3><p>YourSAy is funded by the\u00a0Department of the Premier and Cabinet in South Australia and managed under the state's community engagement program, 'Better Together'.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources and External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://yoursay.sa.gov.au/\">YourSAy Homepage</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YourFutureSA/\">Facebook Page</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/YourFutureSA\">Twitter</a></p><h3>Notes</h3>", "geo_city": "", "tags": null, "geo_province": "South Australia", "title_en": "YourSAy", "methods": "Online Consultations||Online Voting||Community Organizing", "path": "/organizations/yoursay", "geo_phone": "", "geo_latitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" N", "additional": "", "author_uid": "110904", "language": "English", "geo_longitude": "0\u00b0 0' 0\" E", "fulltime_staff": null, "published": "Yes", "lead_image": "{}"}, {"sector": null, "updated_date": "2016-10-03T18:33:28", "volunteer_count": null, "geo_street": "", "executive_director": null, "post_date": "2016-10-03T18:33:28", "other_images": "[]", "content_language": "English", "geo_postal_code": "", "id": "4597", "description": null, "video": null, "geo_name": "", "geo_country": "", "content_country": null, "annual_budget": null, "part-time_staff": null, "issue": null, "body_en": "<p>The following is a suggested structure.
